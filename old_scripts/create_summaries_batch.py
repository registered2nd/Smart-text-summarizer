They record observations in ciphered messages to avoid Papist spying, using a numerical grid system. The natural philosophers struggle with foul-tasting gunpowder "Aurum Fulminans" made by Hooke. Talk turns to Isaac Newton at Cambridge, with Barrow predicting his brilliance in mathematics. Daniel corresponds with Isaac about mechanical philosophy and astronomy while Newton experiments alone with alchemy and prisms. The Christmas season brings familial tensions as Daniel ponders inheritance and his future. Drake hosts controversial religious meetings, maintaining apocalyptic beliefs despite the Restoration. The cottage experiments continue through winter, including failed attempts to create perpetual motion machines. Hooke theorizes about universal gravitation affecting celestial bodies. Political undercurrents persist as the Dutch war preparations continue. Daniel realizes his position bridges two worlds: his father's radical Puritanism and the new mechanical philosophy.""",
    
    14: """Spring 1666 arrives with Cambridge reopening. Daniel returns to find Isaac conducting dangerous alchemical experiments, having made discoveries about light and color using prisms. Newton demonstrates white light contains all colors, revolutionizing optics. His rooms reek of mercury and strange furnaces burn constantly. Isaac shows increasing paranoia about sharing discoveries, using elaborate ciphers and anagrams. He reveals investigations into biblical chronology and ancient wisdom. Daniel witnesses Isaac's physical deterioration from mercury exposure and self-neglect. Their relationship strains as Newton becomes more secretive and obsessive. News arrives of the Dutch fleet's movements, increasing war tensions. London slowly recovers from plague as death rates decline. Natural philosophy advances rapidly with competing claims of discovery. Daniel struggles to balance loyalty to Isaac with connections to the Royal Society. The approaching summer brings ominous portents as both men sense impending changes.""",
