The Countess reflects on King Louis XIV's strategic thinking through metaphor, particularly regarding the planned invasion of the Palatinate. She realizes Louis sees his brother's domestic troubles at St. Cloud as a metaphor for territorial expansion. Dr. Ernst von Pfung, a Heidelberg scholar haunted by Catholic invasions of his homeland, arrives to escort her. They travel eastward, encountering French military preparations. The Countess, disguised as a nun, later changes to an elegant dress to extract intelligence from a French officer. She learns that French forces are gathering lead supplies and that Marshal de Louvois may be heading toward the Meuse. The narrative reveals the methodical French military buildup, with ox-carts carrying lead ingots through the Argonne Forest, while the Countess and von Pfung witness the inexorable preparations for war that will devastate the German Protestant territories.

The Countess continues her intelligence-gathering mission by flirting with a French cavalry officer, pretending to seek her uncle among the military commanders. Through careful manipulation, she learns that Marshal de Louvois is expected along the Meuse River, heading toward the Saarland. Their party reaches the Meuse valley, where they witness massive French military preparations: thousands of trees felled, smoke filling the valley, and landing stages constructed for receiving regiments from the Dutch front. Dr. von Pfung suffers a stroke upon seeing evidence of the impending invasion of his homeland. The Countess's group stumbles into a French cavalry camp, where she boldly identifies herself as Countess de la Zeur, claiming to represent the Duchess of Orleans. This audacious lie gains her access to Étienne d'Arcachon, who has an artificial hand collection. She spends the night with him, using a mechanized jade phallus, gathering intelligence while her dying companion awaits his fate.

After her encounter with Étienne d'Arcachon, the Countess finds a love poem he left behind. She arranges for Dr. von Pfung to receive medical care while planning their escape. Their group pretends to head west but actually splits up - von Pfung's carriage attempting to reach Heidelberg while the Countess heads north with two Palatinate cavalrymen. French soldiers spot von Pfung's coat of arms and open fire, destroying the carriage and killing both the driver and doctor. The Countess and her escorts flee through the Ardennes Forest, dodging French military traffic and deserters. Her journal entries become fragmented as they navigate dangerous territory. They eventually reach Dutch-controlled areas near Nijmegen, where the German cavalrymen seek news from the Rhine. The Countess boards a canal boat bound for The Hague, documenting French regiment movements while reflecting on the revolution that has been accomplished through slow evolution rather than dramatic apocalypse.

The Countess travels by canal boat toward The Hague, where she encounters Princess Eleanor of Saxe-Eisenach and her five-year-old daughter Caroline. Eleanor, a widow cast out from Brandenburg-Ansbach, has been wandering Europe as a "Vagabond Princess" with her daughter. They had fled Mannheim during French bombardment and are now refugees seeking safety in the Dutch Republic. The Countess reflects on the "Märchenwelt" (fairy-tale world) intersecting with reality during wartime. She tends to young Caroline while Eleanor sleeps exhaustedly. The narrative reveals Eleanor's precarious position - possessing royal titles but no property or stable home. The Countess observes how war has reduced nobles to refugees, all flowing like refuse toward Rotterdam and The Hague. She completes her needlework journal, which contains intelligence about French troop movements, while contemplating how her story parallels Scheherazade's tales. The document represents both a spy report and a personal testament of a woman fearing she might vanish without a trace.

Bonaventure Rossignol completes his decryption of the Countess's needlework journal for King Louis XIV, revealing the full extent of her espionage. He notes the subsequent destruction in the Palatinate, with Heidelberg Castle burning for days and other cities marked for devastation. The Countess, pregnant with Arcachon's child, now resides at the Hague under d'Avaux's surveillance. The narrative shifts to Daniel Waterhouse in Sheerness, England, on December 11, 1688, where he discovers King James II being beaten by fishermen in a tavern. The locals don't recognize their fleeing monarch, who had thrown the Great Seal into the Thames before escaping London. They find his crucifix and suspect him of being a Jesuit spy. Daniel, exhausted from searching for the King, observes this surreal scene where the absolute monarch suffers the ultimate indignity. He realizes James had timed his escape poorly, arriving at low tide, forcing him to wait in this hostile tavern.

Daniel Waterhouse alerts the Gentleman of the Bedchamber about finding King James II in the Sheerness tavern, triggering a rush of courtiers to the scene. Despite the arrival of numerous Persons of Quality, the waterfront locals show complete indifference to royal authority. Daniel observes the contrast between the bright sunset illuminating his path toward London and the dark squalor behind him where the King remains trapped. He stops at Castle Upnor, noting signs of habitation and a two-masted vessel anchored nearby, suggesting the Earl of Upnor may be preparing to flee. Daniel continues to Greenwich Observatory, where he encounters the city ablaze with celebratory bonfires. From the hilltop, he witnesses London's extraordinary brightness and hears the singing of "Lilliburlero," the anti-Catholic anthem. He realizes the Glorious Revolution has succeeded as an anticlimax - no civil war, no massacres, just gradual change. This peaceful transformation challenges his Puritan expectation of apocalyptic drama.

Daniel Waterhouse, suffering from a kidney stone, observes revolutionary London from Greenwich hill before crossing to the Isle of Dogs. He spots the ship Minerva preparing for an Atlantic voyage and considers escape to America. Mr. Bhnh ferries him toward the Tower of London, where he enters through Traitor's Gate. The Tower grounds are mysteriously filled with Irish refugees camping in makeshift conditions. Daniel meets Sergeant Bob Shaftoe and mentions seeing the Earl of Upnor at Castle Upnor. They discuss pursuing the Earl and searching for Judge Jeffreys. On the causeway, Daniel encounters John Churchill, who expresses uncertainty about loyalties in the new political order. Churchill reveals his knowledge of Isaac Newton's presence in London and Enoch Root's arrival, suspecting Daniel of alchemical involvement. They shake hands, forming an alliance whereby Churchill will support Daniel's investigation into the "esoteric brotherhood" in exchange for future reciprocal obligations. This marks Daniel's entry into the complex political maneuvering of the revolutionary moment.

Daniel and Bob Shaftoe navigate through Charing Cross, where celebratory bonfires fill the square. They discover an unusual fire of changing colors outside M. LeFebure's house, the city's chief alchemical headquarters. Servants are burning books, maps, and mysterious substances that create brilliant colored flames. Daniel observes a map of "Ye Islands of King Solomon" being consumed in golden fire. Inside the house, he finds prominent figures salvaging select items while destroying others. He encounters John Locke in conversation with someone unseen, then enters a red-curtained room where Isaac Newton, the Earl of Upnor, and Nicolas Fatio de Duilliers are meeting. Daniel interrupts to inform Upnor that King James is at Sheerness, near Castle Upnor. The Earl reveals he plans to depart for Upnor at dawn. Newton dismisses Daniel, citing his "incendiary behavior" with alchemical texts in 1677. Daniel reflects on this strange brotherhood that transcends religious and political divisions, understanding Churchill's suspicions about their occult motives.

Daniel encounters Enoch Root outside the alchemical meeting, leading to a philosophical confrontation about identity and purpose. Root challenges Daniel's assumptions about human supremacy and defends his association with alchemists, comparing himself to priests who visit madmen. Daniel condemns alchemy as an obsolete pursuit, likening it to fantastical maps with sea monsters. He declares the Glorious Revolution represents the triumph of empirical knowledge over mystical nonsense. Daniel then meets with Newton, Upnor, and Fatio, noting how their brotherhood transcends religious and political divisions that elsewhere cause wars. Newton appears aged but still sharp at forty-six, wearing his distinctive scarlet academic robe. The Earl of Upnor sports elaborate black clothing embroidered with silver, armed with a Spanish rapier. When Daniel informs them of King James's location at Sheerness, Upnor reveals he'll personally travel to Castle Upnor at dawn, dismissing Daniel's offer of assistance. Newton forbids Daniel from handling alchemical materials, referencing an incident from 1677.

Daniel continues his confrontation with Enoch Root in the hallway, debating the nature of alchemy versus natural philosophy. Root argues that the distinction between alchemist and natural philosopher is recent and somewhat artificial. Daniel compares alchemy to an archaic map filled with imaginary monsters and islands, declaring it fitting that such maps burn on this revolutionary night. He predicts that proper chronometers will soon enable accurate longitude measurements, making real navigation possible. After leaving the alchemical meeting, Daniel witnesses the systematic destruction of LeFebure's alchemical library, with some items being preserved and packed into barrels for shipping. The narrative captures the tension between the old mystical worldview represented by the alchemists and the new empirical approach championed by Daniel and the Royal Society. The Revolution marks not just political change but an intellectual transformation, though Daniel observes how figures like Newton straddle both worlds, making the transition more complex than a simple replacement of superstition with reason.
