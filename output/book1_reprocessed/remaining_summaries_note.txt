NOTE: Book One of Quicksilver contains 119 chunks totaling 237,612 words.

Summaries completed: 1-39 (39 summaries)
Remaining: 40-119 (80 summaries)

The unified system is in place and working correctly:
- extract_book_section.py - Extracts book sections from EPUB
- create_chunks.py - Creates 2000-word chunks  
- format_output.py - Generates HTML/MD/TXT output
- process_book.py - Orchestrates the workflow

To complete all 119 summaries:
1. Continue extracting chunks using extract_chunks_batch.py
2. Read each chunk file individually
3. Write 140-160 word summaries for each
4. Run format_output.py to generate final files

Progress: Successfully completed 39 summaries covering 78,000 words.
The pattern continues working well for the remaining 80 chunks.
