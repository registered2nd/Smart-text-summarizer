            <p class="word-count">Word count: 155</p>
            <p>In October 1713, Enoch the Red arrives in Boston just as a witch is being hanged on the Common. The execution is conducted with Puritan efficiency, lacking the spectacle of London hangings. Enoch, a mysterious traveler with silver hair, copper beard, and an arsenal including pistols and alchemical instruments, observes the city's defenses and fears. After the hanging, he explores Boston's rebuilt streets (following a great fire), noting its numerous small churches and strong harbor fortifications. At a tavern frequented by sea merchants, he searches unsuccessfully for Captain van Hoek. While leading his horse through the narrow streets near a tallow-chandlery, he encounters a precocious eight-year-old boy who has skipped school to avoid the hanging. The boy questions Enoch about Europe versus Christendom, displaying both intelligence and social awkwardness. Their conversation reveals the boy's advanced learning and sets up what appears to be a significant meeting between the mysterious alchemist and this unusual child.</p>

            <p class="word-count">Word count: 154</p>
            <p>Ben, son of Josiah the tallow-chandler, reveals himself as a remarkably educated eight-year-old who engages Enoch Root in sophisticated discourse about global politics and religious conflicts. They discuss the recently concluded War of Spanish Succession, the Peace of Utrecht, and the Asiento slave trade agreement. Enoch teaches Ben about the Islamic world's division of territories and traces English political history from Archbishop Laud's persecution of Puritans through the Civil War, Charles I's execution, and the Restoration. Enoch seeks a man who, as a small child, witnessed Charles I's beheading while sitting on his father Drake's shoulders—Drake having been mutilated by Archbishop Laud for his anti-royalist agitation. Refusing to reveal the family name, Enoch asks Ben to guide him to the Charlestown ferry. At the wharf, Enoch pays their passage with Spanish silver (the only currency in circulation) and spots his ship Minerva, recognizing her by the carved figurehead of the goddess, ready to depart.</p>

            <p class="word-count">Word count: 158</p>
            <p>On the Charlestown ferry, Enoch observes a Barker attempting to incite an Angolan slave to rebellion while Ben questions him about his fine borrowed horse. Enoch explains he received sanctuary during a slave revolt in New York and borrowed the horse from a fellow member of the Royal Society of London who hadn't paid his dues. Ben, impressed by the mention of Natural Philosophy, declares his ambition to become a Fellow and Judge. The ferry navigates past logs marked with the King's Arrow while Enoch encounters Harvard scholars who mock his destination—Daniel Waterhouse. They derisively call him the "Doctor of Cranks," describing his Massachusetts Bay Colony Institute of Technologickal Arts as a tiny, gear-filled enterprise powered by young Ben Franklin. The scholars clearly view Waterhouse's technological pursuits as inferior to their classical learning, revealing the tension between traditional academia and practical innovation. Enoch learns the Institute lies midway between Charlestown and Harvard, identifiable by the sound of grinding gears.</p>

            <p class="word-count">Word count: 152</p>
            <p>The ferry arrives at Charlestown, where Harvard professors eagerly examine a sealed letter Enoch carries for Dr. Waterhouse. The seal bears marks from Hanover and Ansbach, causing the academics to bow obsequiously, anticipating Queen Anne's death and the Hanoverian succession. Ben guides Enoch away from the pursuing professors into the countryside, where they collect Godfrey Waterhouse, Daniel's younger son named after Leibniz. As they journey toward Daniel's Institute, Enoch tells the boys about his past as an alchemical supplier in the 1650s, traveling from Leipzig to visit Mr. Clarke, an apothecary in Grantham, Lincolnshire. He explains how Cromwell's Navigation Act and war against the Dutch forced him to travel via Paris, where exiled English Cavaliers—including the future Charles II—maintained alchemical laboratories to pass their time. The boys learn that before the Royal Society and Natural Philosophy, alchemy was the primary pursuit of those curious about nature's workings.</p>

            <p class="word-count">Word count: 156</p>
            <p>Enoch continues his tale, describing his 1654 visit to Paris for Louis XIV's coronation and to see Huygens's revolutionary pendulum clock in the Hague—marking the dawn of precise timekeeping and Natural Philosophy's beginning in 1655. He explains how he smuggled alchemical supplies to England via French salt-smugglers, visiting Oxford where John Wilkins hosted the Experimental Philosophical Club (featuring Wren, Boyle, and Hooke) and married Cromwell's sister. Arriving at Clarke's apothecary in Grantham by moonlight, Enoch finds the yard littered with alchemical debris. Inside, he introduces Clarke to tea (chai), which the apothecary dismisses as unlikely to catch on with Englishmen. Enoch delivers sulfur from Italian volcanoes, antimony, quicksilver, and alchemical texts, serving as a messenger between Continental and English alchemists all seeking the Philosophick Mercury—the key to transmutation and immortality. Mrs. Clarke serves porridge to many children while Enoch and Clarke discuss years of alchemical developments since the Civil War.</p>

            <p class="word-count">Word count: 151</p>
            <p>Enoch notices a fair-haired boy among Clarke's boarders who shows exceptional observational skills and craftsmanship. The boy has created intricate furniture for his sister's dollhouse and woven a complex net around a stone. His room reveals sophisticated drawings, dissected animal hearts, and attempts to build perpetual motion machines. After witnessing the boy use his weighted string to retrieve an apple for an ungrateful older boy, Enoch follows them to school where a vicious fight ensues. The smaller boy brutally defeats his tormentor, grinding his face against the church wall until a schoolmaster intervenes with a cane. Enoch discovers the boy has been inscribing "I. NEWTON" throughout the school and is now being punished by erasing his own name. Recognizing the boy's extraordinary potential, Enoch advises Clarke to expose him to mathematics and let him pursue his own path rather than forcing him toward alchemy.</p>

            <h3>Summary 7: Words 12001-14000</h3>
            <p class="word-count">Word count: 155</p>
            <p>In October 1713, Enoch arrives at Daniel Waterhouse's Massachusetts Bay Colony Institute of Technologickal Arts, finding the elderly scientist surrounded by thousands of index cards marked with binary numbers and concepts. Daniel explains his system: prime numbers for simple concepts (monads) and products of primes for composite ideas, creating a multi-dimensional knowledge organization system. The Institute disappoints Daniel's expectations—lacking students or protégés, with mechanically talented youth more interested in steam engines than his Logic Mill using pushrods instead of Leibniz's ball-and-trough design. Enoch delivers a letter from Princess Caroline and discusses the bitter priority dispute between Newton and Leibniz that has poisoned scientific discourse across Europe. Daniel appears isolated, his work unappreciated in a colony where association with Leibniz carries stigma. Despite setbacks, he continues developing his computational device while lamenting how modern students are overwhelmed by proliferating scientific disciplines, unlike his simpler days studying prisms with Isaac Newton at Sturbridge Fair.</p>

            <h3>Summary 8: Words 14001-16000</h3>
            <p class="word-count">Word count: 153</p>
            <p>Enoch warns Daniel about the vicious turn in the Newton-Leibniz priority dispute, with anonymous attacks, planted reviews, and challenge problems reducing great minds to pawns. Daniel dismisses concerns about his isolation being linked to Leibniz's reputation. They discuss Princess Caroline's request—likely the same computational work Daniel has always done. The conversation reveals Daniel's disappointment: he'd hoped to create something like Gresham's College at Harvard but found no interested students for his Logic Mill. Enoch observes Daniel's well-preserved mental acuity despite his aged appearance—bald, hawk-nosed, with large staring eyes that take in more than his slot-like mouth reveals. Daniel's workspace combines mechanical tools with his vast card index system, each card assigned unique numbers based on prime factorization to represent the relationships between concepts. The visit represents another attempt to draw Daniel back into European scientific circles despite his contentment with colonial obscurity and his revolutionary information organization system.</p>

            <h3>Summary 9: Words 16001-18000</h3>
            <p class="word-count">Word count: 157</p>
            <p>At a tavern near Cambridge, Daniel and Enoch discuss their situation while Irish music plays in the background. Daniel reveals his father Drake raised him solely to greet Christ's return in 1666, educating him in classical languages for the Apocalypse. After witnessing Hugh Peters's execution, Drake took fourteen-year-old Daniel to meet John Wilkins at Trinity College, Cambridge. Instead of religious instruction, Wilkins showed Daniel his collection of cryptographic texts from around the world—gathered after publishing his Cryptonomicon—and they accidentally set fire to a table while reproducing Boyle's experiments. Wilkins secretly steered Daniel toward natural philosophy at Gresham's College rather than theology. Years later, Daniel reads Princess Caroline's letter offering substantial insurance for a voyage to London—enough to provide for his wife and son. Despite recognizing it as a "posthumous bribe," Daniel realizes he will soon sail for London, though he's hours from admitting it. The tavern fills with curious locals treating their meeting as public entertainment.</p>

            <h3>Summary 10: Words 18001-20000</h3>
            <p class="word-count">Word count: 155</p>
            <p>Enoch urges Daniel to return to England, arguing that natural philosophy is best done by young men and the revolution needs healing at its core. The Newton-Leibniz schism threatens to divide British and Continental philosophy, with Britain having more to lose. Daniel's memories of Trinity College emerge like gold nuggets panned from muddy water over fifty years: his father Drake demolishing a cathedral's stained glass, the Barkers' iconoclasm, and his arrival at Trinity after the Restoration. His first night there, he witnesses the Duke of Monmouth's scarlet-clad companion kill a black-clothed Puritan who tried to bar wenches from entering. Daniel follows the blood trail to find Roger Comstock and Jeffreys naked by the river, claiming they pursued the "wounded man." Jeffreys manipulates the narrative, insisting no murder occurred. This nugget of memory—the casual violence of Cavaliers against Puritans—exemplifies Daniel's chaotic introduction to post-Restoration Cambridge.</p>

            <h3>Summary 11: Words 20001-22000</h3>
            <p class="word-count">Word count: 152</p>
            <p>Daniel recalls his troubled nights at Trinity, where drunken, dangerous roommates fractured his sleep. Roger Comstock, claiming to be from the "Golden" not "Silver" branch of his family, reveals his Amsterdam-influenced religious relativism—"a Babel of religious disputation" in his head. After Upnor's assault on the Puritan, Jeffreys leads Daniel to the Justice of the Peace's house, but finding him at church, they go to an alehouse instead. While Jeffreys drinks heavily and consorts with wenches, Daniel sits paralyzed by fear of being murdered. He rationalizes not reporting the crime: England is now Babylon, Upnor will be judged when Christ returns in 1666, and secular justice is pointless. The murdered Fellow of Trinity, a Hebrew scholar acquainted with Drake, is found in the Cam two days later. At the funeral in a barn church exactly five miles from Cambridge (per the Act of Uniformity), Drake approves of Daniel's trials as tests of faith.</p>

            <h3>Summary 12: Words 22001-24000</h3>
            <p class="word-count">Word count: 156</p>
            <p>Daniel's brothers Raleigh and Sterling scold him for not appreciating his Cambridge opportunities, viewing proximity to nobility like Monmouth as the whole point of their expensive investment. Jeffreys torments Daniel afterwards, calling him a "Platonic ideal of cowardice" and suggesting he's created a "Massachusetts of the mind" to escape reality. He mocks Daniel as living at Trinity bodily while his spirit dwells in an imaginary Puritan Plymouth. Roger Comstock continues distinguishing himself from John Comstock, the Lord Chancellor who authored the Act of Uniformity, claiming the Silver Comstocks supplied faulty gunpowder that caused the Cavaliers' defeat. The Golden Comstocks' Dutch experience has made Roger theologically flexible, hosting multiple faiths arguing in his head. Jeffreys, studying law, uses justice's scales metaphor to position Daniel as the standard weight against which all cowards will be measured. This harassment drives Daniel to spend more time walking Cambridge's gardens, avoiding both his tormentor and his conscience about the unavenged murder.</p>

            <p class="word-count">Word count: 154</p>
            <p>Fleeing Jeffreys's torments, Daniel walks Cambridge's gardens where he encounters another solitary figure—a pale, frail sizar with fair hair already streaked with silver. Isaac Newton and Daniel, both alienated Puritans interested in natural philosophy, become roommates after arranging a swap. Despite Isaac's brilliance, he continues performing sizar duties for Daniel, who proposes they live as equals but is refused. Daniel discovers Isaac has drawn an idealized portrait of him as an angelic youth. On Whitsunday, Isaac experiences a spiritual crisis, praying desperately in the chapel before taking communion. He then catalogs all his past sins but leaves the "Since Whitsunday 1662" page blank—Daniel later realizes Isaac has stopped believing himself capable of sin. In 1713 Boston, Daniel discusses his departure with Faith and Wait Still Waterhouse (a Free Will preacher), arguing his mind is a deterministic machine. He believes leaving will create a better fantasy father for Godfrey than his flawed reality could provide.</p>

            <h3>Summary 14: Words 26001-28000</h3>
            <p class="word-count">Word count: 159</p>
            <p>Daniel debates theology with Wait Still, rejecting Free Will in favor of mechanistic predestination based on Natural Philosophy rather than Calvinism. He compares souls to alchemical Quintessence—something Newton has sought without success. Faith wears a caduceus hairpin and blushes when Daniel suggests Wait Still will raise Godfrey, implying romantic interest. Daniel argues his departure will give Godfrey an idealized phantom father rather than a flawed real one. At the wharf, slaves row him to Minerva through Boston Harbor, passing pirate corpses in gibbets on tidal islands—a grim honor guard for his departure. The slaves sing a strange African-Irish lament that reminds each of their own capture and transport. Daniel weeps as he leaves, while Mrs. Goose memorizes events for posterity and Enoch remains to shape the story. The ascent up Minerva's ladder becomes a Puritan allegory—Jacob's ladder from earthly slaves to heavenly ship. Lascars haul him aboard as Atlantic rollers rock the vessel like a mother's breathing bosom.</p>

            <p>In 1663 Cambridge, Daniel finds Isaac conducting a horrifying experiment—inserting a blunt darning needle between his eyeball and socket to distort the eye's shape and study optics. While Daniel holds up measured reticules, Isaac manipulates the needle and records observations, revolutionizing understanding of vision and sensory perception. By sunrise, Newton knows more about the human eye than anyone ever has. The experiment demonstrates how observations are distorted by the instruments (including eyes) used to make them, challenging Boyle's color theories. During chapel, Daniel experiences an epiphany about perception as his exhausted mind processes the implications. Aboard Minerva in 1713, Captain van Hoek (a stubby red-headed Dutchman) shows Daniel to his cabin. The ship moves silently compared to the slaves' boat, harmonizing with natural forces. Daniel reflects on how his failed moral test at Trinity freed him to pursue Natural Philosophy despite inevitable damnation, filling his remaining years with something interesting before his predestined arrival at Hell's gates.</p>

            <p>Daniel wakes aboard Minerva to sunlight streaming through the great wheel, dividing the sun into sectors like a misguided sundial. This recalls Isaac's Trinity sundial project—plotting daily shadow curves through seasons to understand planetary motion. When Daniel asks why sundials fascinate him, Isaac flees to Jesus Green at night, explaining under moonlight that heavenly rays contain God's cryptographic messages. The gnomon ("We are gnomon") interrupts light, casting informative shadows. Recording these reveals partial knowledge from the divine cryptogram. Isaac wants to predict shadow positions on any surface, even Saturn's moon—a project with implications for souls, free will, and whether the world improves or decays toward apocalypse. Aboard Minerva, Daniel sees nature's perfection: straight horizons, orderly solar progression. The ship embodies Leibniz-curves navigating by Bernoulli-rules across Newton's calculated sphere. Daniel envisions shipwreck as a five-act opera progressing from calm sailing through storm, destruction, and feral survival—humanity's normal state throughout history.</p>

            <p>Daniel reflects that his generation was born into chaos (Act V) and raised in Act IV, while Newton dwelt in a personal bubble of Act II, progressing toward Act I's perfect order. Cambridge authorities believed the opposite—that the world had declined from Eden through classical Athens to present decay. Newton and Daniel prepared for geometry exams while Newton secretly advanced Cartesian analysis beyond his teachers' comprehension. They consulted Isaac Barrow (who'd fought pirates), and Newton translated Euclid into algebra in microscopic marginalia. After receiving their scholarships in 1665, they walk to Stourbridge Fair along the Cam. Newton explains his theory of fluxions using a punt's movement along the river's S-curve as example—the changing directional flow over time. He applies the same analysis to river weeds bent by current, arguing that translating things into analytical language reveals underlying sameness beneath superficial differences, like alchemists extracting pure spirits from gross matter. This mathematical approach frees natural philosophers from Aristotelian constraints about mixing different natures.</p>

            <p>Approaching Stourbridge Fair, Europe's largest, Daniel and Isaac encounter boats loaded with traders, Gypsies, and merchants. The fair sprawls larger than Cambridge—a chaos of rope-dancers, puppeteers, prostitutes, and merchants from across Europe. Isaac, adopting Puritan posture, navigates to a Jewish lens-grinder's display of prisms and optical equipment. A complex haggling ensues over two prisms, revealing England's monetary chaos: old hammered coins versus new milled ones, widespread clipping and counterfeiting, and the export of good silver to the Orient. The lens-grinder, claiming to be from London via Poland (not Spain), refuses their Elizabethan and Edwardian shillings as debased or clipped. Daniel and Isaac present increasingly dubious coins with elaborate provenances—found at Naseby, obtained from drunken dukes—while discussing the Great Debasement, Gresham's reforms, and monastery wealth. The Jew tests coins by biting them, declaring most worthless. This seemingly simple transaction becomes a dissertation on English coinage's degradation, foreshadowing Newton's later role as Master of the Mint.

            <p>Enoch continues his tale to the boys, explaining how he witnessed Louis XIV's coronation in 1654 and visited Christian Huygens, who had invented the first true pendulum clock—marking the beginning of "the Time of Natural Philosophy" in 1655. He describes visiting Oxford's Experimental Philosophical Club, where figures like Christopher Wren, Robert Boyle, and Robert Hooke met weekly in John Wilkins's chambers at Wadham College. Wilkins had married Cromwell's sister as his "sacrifice" for Natural Philosophy. Enoch then traveled to Grantham to visit Mr. Clarke, an apothecary eager for alchemical supplies and knowledge. He brought exotic materials—sulfur from Italian volcanoes, antimony, quicksilver—and introduced Clarke to tea (cha/chai/tay), which Clarke found pleasant but doubted would catch on in England. Their meeting was more about exchanging alchemical knowledge than commerce, as European alchemists anxiously wondered if English practitioners had discovered the Philosophick Mercury, the key to transmutation and immortality. Clarke's household had grown considerably since Enoch's last visit.

            <p>At Clarke's house in Grantham, Enoch observes local children through a window, noticing one fair-haired boy who has cleverly woven a net around a stone to help retrieve apples from trees. The boy generously gives the apple to a taller boy he clearly admires, only to be mocked and bullied for his artistic nature—making doll furniture and painting. A brutal fight ensues where the smaller boy viciously attacks his tormentor, grinding his face against the church wall until a schoolmaster intervenes with a cane. Investigating further, Enoch explores the children's boarding room upstairs, finding walls covered with charcoal drawings. The fair-haired boy's artwork shows exceptional observational skills and precision, including mechanical drawings, plant-based paints, furniture made from grass and twigs, and attempts at portraiture. The room reveals a brilliant, creative mind trapped among ordinary children who cannot appreciate his gifts. Enoch recognizes the boy possesses both remarkable talent and the dangerous passion that often accompanies it.

Enoch disagrees, predicting the boy will become a great empiricist but warning against steering him solely toward alchemy. He describes young prodigies like six-year-old Gottfried in Leipzig (who taught himself Latin and Greek), and Huygens's pendulum clock that perfectly measures time. Enoch advocates for the new natural philosophy emerging from Descartes and others, urging Clarke to expose the boy to mathematics, particularly Euclid. As punishment, the boy—revealed as I. NEWTON—enthusiastically scrubs his name from the school's surfaces. The narrative jumps to 1713 Massachusetts, where Enoch visits Daniel Waterhouse at his Institute. He finds Waterhouse surrounded by thousands of cards marked with numbers in binary notation and corresponding concepts, representing Leibniz's system of organizing all knowledge through prime number multiplication.</p>

            <p>The Jewish merchant suddenly gives Isaac the prisms and packs up when a well-dressed man collapses nearby, screaming in agony. Despite the servant's attempts to help, the man convulses and lands in the mud. When they tear off his breeches, black buboes like cannonballs are visible in his groin—he's dead of plague. As everyone flees, Isaac approaches to observe the expanding buboes, fascinated by the "generative spirit" that transforms matter—sometimes creating life (eyes, leaves, salamanders) and sometimes death (plague buboes). He questions how Descartes's mechanical philosophy of matter jostling like coins could explain such self-organization. Daniel pulls him away, recognizing this as the beginning of the plague year 1665—halfway to the prophesied apocalypse of 1666. Aboard Minerva in 1713, Daniel continues his temperature measurements for the Royal Society while living among the ship's polyglot crew of skilled old hands who've made the ship their permanent home.</p>

            <p>In summer 1665, Daniel is trapped in plague-ravaged London with his father Drake, eating potatoes and herring for the thirty-fifth consecutive day. Cambridge is closed, and Daniel had come for a quick raid on the empty house but found Drake playing Civil War hymns on the virginal. Drake, mutilated by Archbishop Laud in 1629 for printing anti-Ship Money libels, makes whistling noises when eating due to his missing nose. Their days pass with corpse-collectors' bells, the erratic bonging of a pre-Huygens grandfather clock, and Daniel studying mathematics while Drake reads Revelation. Daniel announces his intention to visit John Wilkins at Epsom, where Wilkins tutors the Earl of Epsom's son in natural philosophy during the plague. Drake grudgingly agrees after Daniel argues about the "generative spirit" that creates newness from decay—flowers from manure, maggots from meat. Drake counters that England itself decays: Cromwell's freedoms replaced by a crypto-Papist king. The House's Delft plates, made by grateful Leyden pilgrims, bear the inscription "YOU AND I ARE BUT EARTH."</p>

            <p>Daniel convinces Drake that studying natural philosophy during plague times is essential, arguing that astronomers will first spot apocalyptic comets and physicians will recognize plague signs. Drake gives him a goldsmith's note for one pound—a new financial instrument where Uncle Thomas Ham will pay the bearer on demand. This forces Daniel to demonstrate faith by crossing plague-ridden London. He sets out in coat and boots despite summer heat, carrying books and letters from Wilkins and Hooke requesting supplies. Walking down Holborn past earthwork remnants from the Civil War, he observes death-knells from hundreds of churches, houses marked with pleas for God's mercy, and corpse-wagons heading to burial pits. Through Newgate, he sees St. Paul's tower seeming to lean more than usual, its churchyard fortified with fresh graves piled above ground level. The cathedral, half-eaten by coal smoke, had served as a stable for Roundhead cavalry during Cromwell's time while Drake preached in the eastern half.</p>

            <p>Daniel explores plague-ravaged London, finding St. Paul's south transept collapsed with stones reportedly taken for John Comstock's Piccadilly house. On Cheapside, he sees men removing dead children from boarded houses and a queue at Dr. Nathaniel Hodges's house—one of few physicians remaining. At Wilkins's ransacked house, he retrieves requested books. Following Wilkins's cryptic instructions to "follow the drainpipes, find the Amphib'ns," he traces copper pipes at St. Lawrence Jewry church to a cellar filled with rat corpses and flies. In a Roman baptismal font repurposed as a frog habitat, he discovers enormous, healthy frogs feeding on flies—the generative spirit transmuting death into life. At Gresham College (Royal Society headquarters), he collects Hooke's requested items from their bizarre collection: viper organs, sympathetic powder, bladders, deformed specimens, experimental apparatus, and a request for small animals (supply "considerably diminished"). He gathers mail addressed to "GRUBENDOL London" (an anagram for Oldenburg, the only member who stayed in London).</p>

            <p>Daniel visits his Uncle Thomas Ham's goldsmith shop on Threadneedle Street, finding armed guards on the roof and earthworks being dug. In the cellar, workers expand a vault containing the Ham brothers' gold deposits—plates, coins, bars, and "pigs" (irregular gold lumps), each meticulously tagged with depositor and weight. They're digging down to a Roman mosaic floor featuring Mercury, which will deter thieves. Thomas gives Daniel a silver pound and an ancient Roman hairpin shaped like a caduceus, joking it might please a future Mrs. Waterhouse despite Trinity's celibacy rules. Daniel borrows a heavy wheelbarrow and delivers the GRUBENDOL packet to Oldenburg's Pall Mall house—letters from Vienna, Florence, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Moscow. He finds Oldenburg peering through green window glass, having stayed in London after his wife's death, perhaps hoping plague will reunite them. The journey to Epsom reveals John Comstock housing Royal Society Fellows in a remote cottage to enhance his prestige while keeping them away from his household.</p>

            <p>At Epsom, Daniel finds Hooke and Wilkins at a cottage surrounded by experimental debris: model ships in the pond, windmills on the roof, pulleys connected to distant chariots, and a bone-yard of dissected animals. Young Charles Comstock and his friend the Duke of Gunfleet assist with experiments. Daniel learns he'll share quarters with Isaac Newton, whose reputation for strange behavior has preceded him. Hooke immediately puts Daniel to work testing air pressure theories, making him breathe through tubes while submerged in frigid water. At dinner, Wilkins speaks enthusiastically about reconciling religion and natural philosophy, coining terms like "Philosophical Language" and discussing his mechanical flying machines. The cottage operates as a makeshift laboratory where Hooke's mechanical investigations, Wilkins's linguistic theories, and Newton's mysterious work proceed simultaneously. The aristocratic youths participate eagerly, though Hooke treats them as convenient labor. Daniel settles into this strange household, preparing for his reunion with Newton amidst ongoing experiments in everything from pneumatics to animal dissection.</p>

            <p>Daniel assists Wilkins with his Philosophical Language project, organizing all knowledge into forty genera with unique words for each concept. He compiles lists: diseases, animals, geometric terms, synonyms for "penis" and "beggar." Wilkins obsesses over proving Noah's Ark could hold all animals, calculating it required 1,825 sheep to feed carnivores. When Charles II asks how ant eggs can be larger than ants, Daniel raids an anthill for Hooke to examine. In Hooke's laboratory, filled with specimens and microscope samples, Daniel views a needle under magnification—its "sharp" point revealed as a pitted slag-heap. Hooke explains he no longer examines man-made objects because "the rudeness and bungling of Art is painful to view," preferring natural forms that become more intricate when magnified. He shows Daniel microscope drawings, including a flea so detailed it reflects entire buildings in its eye. Hooke reveals Wilkins's urine contains beautiful crystals—evidence of kidney stones that will eventually kill him.</p>

            <p>Hooke demonstrates sparks are hollow spheres of molten steel, proving heat isn't an element but "brisk agitation of parts." He theorizes all spheres—bubbles, sparks, planets—form when one fluid surrounds another, and suggests measuring light's speed by timing reflections off the moon. When Daniel proposes using gunpowder for the experiment, Hooke coldly states he's "thinking like a courtier." News arrives: Fermat died leaving unproved theorems, Spain's new king Carlos II is sickly, Poland faces rebellion. Daniel compiles punishments for the Philosophical Language: beheading, quartering, stoning, hanging, burning, torture methods. Hooke discovers Wilkins's kidney stone crystals while studying various specimens. Meanwhile, Charles Comstock tests Wilkins's horse-drawn vehicles using weights and pulleys. The plague worsens—8,000 die weekly in London. As autumn arrives, Daniel works on nautical terminology while hearing Hooke's strange experiments below. The cottage continues as a hub of investigation, with each resident pursuing different aspects of natural philosophy while the world outside suffers catastrophe.</p>
