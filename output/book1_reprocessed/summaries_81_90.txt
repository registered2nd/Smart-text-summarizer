This chunk contains an interview with Neal Stephenson about Quicksilver, discussing his inspiration from Newton and Leibniz's work with money and computing machines 300 years ago. He explains the historical setting during the late seventeenth century that led to the Enlightenment, and discusses both real historical figures (Newton, Leibniz, Samuel Pepys) and fictional characters (Jack Shaftoe, Eliza). Jack represents the vagrant class common in that era, while Eliza was formerly enslaved by Barbary Corsairs. Stephenson describes his research methods, including reading extensively and visiting historical locations, though results varied - some buildings remained intact while others, like the Royal Society's Crane Court headquarters, had been replaced by modern structures. The chunk includes technical publishing information and e-book formatting details.

Stephenson discusses his use of deliberate anachronisms in Quicksilver, explaining that historical fiction inevitably reflects its contemporary period, citing examples like Dumas's Victorian-influenced swashbucklers. He describes the Royal Society's disturbing vivisection experiments and members' eventual discomfort with the practice. The text reveals Newton's extensive involvement in alchemy, which was suppressed during the Enlightenment but was actually widespread among natural philosophers including Boyle and Locke. Language plays a crucial role in the novel - English was then a minor language, leading John Wilkins to create an artificial universal language for scientific communication. The mysterious land of Qwghlm is introduced as an unpronounceable northern territory with a runic writing system. The chunk concludes with metadata about the Quicksilver Metaweb project, explaining it as an experimental knowledge repository using GNU Free Documentation License, aimed at creating useful explanations beyond simple FAQs.

Daniel Waterhouse observes Isaac Newton's mysterious London activities in 1670, following him to Charing Cross where Newton enters Monsieur LeFebure's establishment, a chemist's shop. A gentleman rider who had been following Newton is humiliated by the Earl of Upnor in a staged incident involving fake excrement on the Earl's elaborate boots. The scene showcases Restoration fashion excess, with Upnor wearing an outfit of extraordinary complexity including twenty-foot sleeves, black silk doilies, ribbons, and boots with tops folded multiple times. Daniel uses a reflecting telescope of Newton's design to spy on the shop, where he discovers Newton in deep conversation with the Earl of Upnor. The text includes detailed descriptions of Restoration London's geography, from Mrs. Green's Coffee-House to Whitehall Palace, revealing the social dynamics and architectural landscape of the period.

Daniel continues surveillance at Mrs. Green's Coffee-House, where London's Quality gather. Sir Winston Churchill awkwardly greets Daniel, remembering too late that the King had blown up Daniel's father Drake. The scene reveals complex family dynamics - Daniel's half-siblings are involved in a real estate conspiracy, planning development on London's burnt areas. Sterling Waterhouse has shifted from smuggling to fixed retail shops. The reflecting telescope attracts attention, forcing Daniel to pack it away. Details emerge about Drake's death in an explosion that scattered him toward the Great Fire, with John Wilkins preventing the funeral from becoming a riot. The text explores Restoration fashion, social etiquette, and the emerging commercial culture. Churchill's son John is fighting corsairs in Barbary, adding military context. The scene demonstrates how the Waterhouse family has adapted to post-Restoration society, with various members achieving titles and engaging in land speculation schemes.

Sterling and Beatrice Waterhouse's shopping expedition encounters Daniel at the coffee-house, revealing the family's involvement in a real estate development scheme. Daniel deduces they plan to build townhouses around a square with Sterling's shops, essentially "farming rich people." The gathering includes elaborate Restoration fashion descriptions - Sir Winston in black velvet with yellow waistcoat and ring-curled wig, Mrs. Churchill with black velvet beauty spots creating a Dalmatian effect. Discussion touches on family members including Praise-God at Harvard and Thomas Ham (now Viscount Walbrook), whose gold survived the Fire in a massive congealed slab. The scene captures the transformation of post-Fire London society, with new money, titles, and development opportunities. Earl of Upnor appears crossing Charing Cross in an even more elaborate outfit featuring boot-tops like bushel-baskets and a wig wider than his shoulders, demonstrating fashion as social performance.

The Earl of Upnor's boot-scraping incident concludes with the gentleman rider being forced to grovel, literally putting his nose to the Earl's boot while urinating in fear. The rider reveals he had followed Newton on Upnor's orders before being publicly humiliated. Daniel discovers Newton at Monsieur LeFebure's shop, identified as a "chymist," where Newton converses intently with Upnor. Daniel experiences jealousy over Newton's secret friendships and alchemical interests. The narrative shifts to a Royal Society meeting at Gresham's College in August 1670, featuring various experiments including Hooke's spirit level, discussions of Saturn's rings, medical curiosities, and failed vivisection attempts. Notable is the presentation of Newton's reflecting telescope by Daniel, which impresses Wren, Hooke, and the Duke of Gunfleet. The meeting exemplifies the period's blend of serious science with bizarre demonstrations, including a vagrant displaying his exposed colon.

The Royal Society meeting continues with discussions of moss growing on skulls, Dr. de Graaf's unraveled testicles, and tarantula bites. Daniel presents Newton's reflecting telescope, earning praise. The scene shifts to the Dogg tavern where Wilkins metaphorically explains Oldenburg's importance as the "heart" of the Royal Society, pumping correspondence between England and Continental scientists. Oldenburg has been imprisoned in the Tower on vague suspicions due to his German origins, diplomatic background, and voluminous foreign correspondence that authorities cannot understand. Pepys reveals this is precautionary during "tender negotiations." The conversation becomes cryptic, discussing treaties and correspondence between "his highness" and "Minette," suggesting secret diplomatic channels. Daniel observes London's geography, noting noble houses along Piccadilly facing St. James's Palace, with Comstock House having the prime direct view, symbolizing the intersection of science, politics, and social power in Restoration society.

The mysterious "Phosphorus" demonstration is announced for Whitehall Palace, with Enoch the Red presenting this new elemental substance. The scene exposes court intrigue and coded diplomatic communications, with references to treaties and French connections. Daniel feels like an apprentice to Wilkins, who seems to be grooming him for some purpose. The narrative emphasizes the period's intersection of natural philosophy, espionage, and politics. Comstock's Persian vest represents latest court fashion, while Daniel remains in outdated Puritan garb. The coach route from Comstock House to St. James's reveals London's evolving urban landscape, with construction sites and noble residences reshaping the post-Fire city. Political tensions simmer beneath scientific discourse.

The coach arrives at Monsieur LeFebure's shop where Enoch the Red emerges with glowing phosphorescent fingers and cloak hem, joining the party. They proceed through Whitehall's architectural chaos - Gothic gates, Renaissance buildings, Puritan walls, and Dutch gables creating a stylistic collision. The plaza where Charles I was beheaded serves as a reminder of recent history. Palace life continues with its public right-of-way through the Great Court to Whitehall Stairs. Descriptions detail the Banqueting House with Rubens's ceiling depicting Minerva strangling Rebellion, Lady Castlemaine's apartments, and Horse Guards behind gun-slitted walls. The scene captures Restoration London's layered history and competing architectural styles, while mysterious phosphorus experiments promise new scientific wonders. Daniel, perched atop the coach, observes this convergence of political power, scientific innovation, and social transformation that characterizes the era's complexity.
