Eliza writes to d'Avaux from Versailles, discussing her newfound acceptance by Madame (Liselotte), who previously scorned her but now recognizes her due to her financial independence through investments. Eliza analyzes Madame's psychology: her hatred of ambitious young women like de Maintenon and her preference for those with external assets. At Versailles, young noblewomen have limited time to secure their futures through marriage or face convent life—making them desperately cruel. Eliza's investment activities distinguish her from these "plucked roses," earning Madame's respect. They discuss hunting, with Eliza humorously describing Qwghlm's poverty and lack of proper saddles. Meanwhile, Daniel remains imprisoned in the Tower of London in summer 1688, in the same chamber where Oldenburg was held twenty years earlier. His world consists of stone walls covered with ancient graffiti from condemned prisoners. He expects imminent murder by Jeffreys but finds only silence and time for spiritual reflection, discovering his soul as empty as a "sacked cathedral"—no wife, children, or lasting accomplishments beyond being "son of Drake."

After twenty days imprisonment, Daniel observes major changes at the Tower—new guards from the King's Own Black Torrent Guards replace the previous regiment, suggesting political upheaval. His conditions improve with better food and oysters from Roger Comstock, challenging his theory about disembodied consciousness as the oysters' sensual pleasure affects him profoundly. He recalls his former mistress Tess's horrific smallpox death as a warning against fleshly pleasures. Robert Hooke visits, bringing ale and observing Daniel's attempts to reconstruct Newton's proofs on the wall. Their conversation reveals deep professional jealousy, with Hooke confessing envy of Newton's Principia. Daniel eloquently defends Hooke's unique perceptual genius compared to Newton's mathematical brilliance, arguing that Hooke sees what millions have looked at but never perceived. A master sergeant arrives, younger than expected but battle-scarred, who reveals the kingdom's crisis: widespread disbelief that James II's son is legitimate, rumors of a changeling smuggled in a warming-pan, and the King's resulting political retreat from both Catholic and Anglican positions.

The sergeant reveals Daniel's precarious position as Churchill commands the Guards but the King no longer trusts him, hence their relocation to the Tower. A letter arrives for "Grubendol" from Leibniz, which the sergeant recognizes as Daniel's correspondence. The sergeant confronts Daniel about conveying letters to William of Orange and mentions written orders from Jeffreys allowing only "Bob Carver and Dick Gripp" to visit—obvious aliases for assassins. Daniel begs the sergeant to rebel against these murderous orders. Leibniz's letter discusses his upcoming journey to Italy for genealogical research supporting Sophie's claims, and his failed silver-mining venture in the Harz mountains. He then launches into profound philosophical discourse about geometrical versus non-geometrical truths, critiquing both Descartes' flawed collision theory and Newton's limitation to geometrical explanations. Leibniz introduces his concept of mv² (vis viva) as a conserved quantity transcending geometry into algebra, representing work and energy. He argues this demonstrates truths beyond Newton's geometrical dome—truths involving fitness and final causes that Newton dismisses as merely "how God made it," relegating them to alchemy rather than natural philosophy.

Leibniz continues his philosophical argument, asserting that mv² represents non-geometrical truths about the universe that Newton wrongly attributes to God's arbitrary choice. Unlike alchemists who see mystical forces everywhere, Leibniz recognizes only bodies and minds, believing God must reveal nature through mechanical laws we can understand. He asks Daniel to defend him to the Royal Society, clarifying he seeks to extend, not destroy, Newton's work. Sergeant Bob Shaftoe arrives announcing "Bob Carver and Dick Gripp," but reveals he's not admitting the assassins—he had Dick Gripp whipped and recruited both into the King's guards. Bob Carver confessed Jeffreys ordered them to slowly cut Daniel's throat. Shaftoe proposes a pact: they'll kill both Jeffreys and Upnor (who owns Shaftoe's love Abigail, one of the Taunton schoolgirls sold during the Bloody Assizes). Daniel, who has kidney stones and expects to die within a year, agrees. Shaftoe explains that Jeffreys's attempt to murder Daniel signals he's abandoning the dynasty and preparing to flee—making him vulnerable to England's coming revolution.

Daniel agrees to join Shaftoe's plot against Jeffreys, explaining that revolution differs from rebellion—it's inexorable like stellar motion, driven by unseen powers. He realizes Jeffreys's decision to kill him indicates the Lord Chancellor is abandoning James II's cause. Daniel abandons his unfinished geometric proof on the wall, declaring it obsolete. The narrative shifts to November 1688 at Château Juvisy, where royal cryptanalyst Bonaventure Rossignol writes to Louis XIV about intercepting correspondence from the Countess de la Zeur (Eliza). Rossignol inherited his position from his father, who helped suppress Huguenot rebellions through code-breaking. He's particularly interested in Eliza's voluminous letters to Leibniz, suspecting they contain encrypted messages despite appearing to be mere descriptions of Versailles fashion. D'Avaux had informed him that Eliza is an agent of William of Orange, connected to Fatio de Duilliers. Rather than arrest her immediately, they hope to break her cipher. Eliza's August letter from St. Cloud uses transparent metaphors—the King's hunting dogs Phobos and Deimos represent French military might threatening either the Dutch Republic or Palatinate.

Eliza's letter continues describing St. Cloud's decadent atmosphere, where Monsieur (the King's brother) entertains male lovers while Madame (Liselotte) remains isolated with her lap-dogs. The household politics mirror court intrigues, with Monsieur's favorites undermining Madame's attendants. Liselotte refuses fashion games, having costumes sewn as single constructs she can step into quickly. Eliza uses elaborate metaphors: the King's hunting dogs Phobos and Deimos represent French armies that have "killed chickens" (conquered Savoy) and now seek new targets—either north (Dutch Republic) or east (Palatinate). The letter mentions a promised bareback riding demonstration. Rossignol reports that Eliza did go riding with Madame, supposedly fell off, and was taken to a convent for recovery—obviously a cover story for pregnancy. However, d'Avaux later spotted her arriving in The Hague on a canal boat from Nijmegen, among Palatinate refugees including Princess Eleanor of Saxe-Eisenach and Wilhelmina Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach. This proves Eliza has "run her true colors up the mast" as William of Orange's agent, abandoning her French cover.

D'Avaux reports to Rossignol that Eliza has taken residence in William of Orange's Binnenhof palace, openly revealing her allegiance. She arrived with minimal possessions: ruined clothes, an embroidery frame with water-damaged crewel-work, and basic personal items. Despite having nothing else, she guards the embroidery jealously, even sleeping with it. After meeting with William for three days, he withdrew troops and launched his invasion of England. Rossignol travels to The Hague in October 1688, arriving as William's fleet departs. Through investigation and Occam's Razor, he deduces Eliza encoded intelligence in her embroidery using cross-stitch orientation (northwest-southeast vs. southwest-northeast) to represent binary digits. With help from Qwghlmian sailors, he realizes she used their incredibly concise runic language—16 consonants perfectly suited to 4-bit binary encoding. After translation by a Jesuit priest fluent in Qwghlmian, Rossignol obtains 40,000 Latin words from Eliza's 30,000 runes. The decoded journal reveals how she traveled from St. Cloud to Nijmegen, beginning with her August rendezvous with Madame for the supposed bareback riding demonstration.

Rossignol explains his cryptanalysis of Eliza's embroidery, discovering she used binary encoding where cross-stitch orientation represents 1s and 0s. Each Qwghlmian rune requires four binary digits, creating an efficient cipher from an already cryptic language. Eliza's decoded journal begins August 17, 1688, revealing she escaped St. Cloud hidden in a boat, then traveled up the Seine and Marne rivers disguised as a boy. Aboard the chaland of M. LeBrun, she observes river traffic while pretending to be his simple-minded son. She develops a method to detect heavily-laden vessels by timing their rocking motion with Huygens's watch—ships carrying dense cargo like lead in their bilges rock more slowly than those with distributed loads. This allows her to identify suspicious chalands heading upriver despite their innocent-looking cargo of barrels. At St.-Dizier she changes to women's clothes and lodges at a dissolute convent, posing as Liselotte's relative traveling to collect inheritance from the Palatinate. She awaits an escort that never arrives, using the time to investigate mysterious nighttime cargo operations at the docks.

At St.-Dizier's convent, Eliza observes suspicious cargo operations at night. Disguised in boy's clothes, she witnesses heavy objects being unloaded from chalands under supervision of a fashionably-dressed courtier. When discovered, she escapes with local Vagabonds and hires one to track the ox-carts carrying the cargo. She identifies the courtier as the Chevalier d'Adour through a seal on a letter to his cousin Eloise, learning he serves Maréchal Louvois. Her hired spy reports the heavy cargo travels east through Lorraine to Alsace, converging on the fortress of Haguenau where trees are being felled for firewood and lumber. Eliza deduces the lead is being melted into ammunition while lumber builds barges to transport it down tributaries to the Rhine. She realizes the Chevalier de Lorraine, Monsieur's chief lover, facilitates military movements through his territory—showing how France exploits even intimate court relationships for strategic advantage. The preparations clearly indicate an imminent invasion of the Palatinate, explaining why her promised escort from Heidelberg never arrived.

Eliza's journal reveals how court relationships serve France's military strategy: the Chevalier de Lorraine, though technically a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor, is completely surrounded by French territory and serves French interests while maintaining his position as Monsieur's lover. She recognizes that lead shipments to Haguenau indicate imminent invasion of the Palatinate via Rhine barges. The narrative structure shows Rossignol presenting Eliza's decoded journal to Louis XIV as translated from Qwghlmian runes embedded in her embroidery—a remarkably sophisticated intelligence operation. The journal entries demonstrate Eliza's analytical skills: using physics to detect weapons shipments, employing street criminals for surveillance, and interpreting court politics' strategic implications. Her cover story about collecting Liselotte's inheritance provides perfect justification for traveling toward the Palatinate, though the invasion preparations explain why her escort never materialized. The document illustrates the era's intersection of personal relationships, court intrigue, and military intelligence, with Eliza successfully gathering crucial information about French invasion plans while maintaining her cover identity until reaching Dutch territory.
