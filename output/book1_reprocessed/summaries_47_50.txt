Eliza writes from Versailles about being elevated to "Countess de la Zeur" by Louis XIV, who declared her secretly of noble blood from Qwghlm. This political fiction serves French interests as Louis prepares for potential conflict with England by courting Ireland, Scotland, and other territories. Father Édouard de Gex questions her about Qwghlmian Church practices, seeking to merge it with Catholicism. Meanwhile, in April 1688 London, Daniel awakens drugged in the Star Chamber with Lord Chancellor Jeffreys presiding over a mock trial. Daniel finds himself wearing a barbaric iron collar with protruding hooks designed to prevent slave escapes—a torture device from Caribbean plantations. Jeffreys, now grossly aged from his years of judicial murders, accuses Daniel of perverting the English language by using "revolution" in a political rather than astronomical sense. The sham court has already interrogated witnesses including Newton, who confirmed he only uses "revolution" to mean celestial motion.

Jeffreys tortures Daniel by spinning the iron collar, using it to demonstrate his twisted philosophy that revolutions inevitably involve violence—the high must be made low, but the high resist with armies and navies. He sentences Daniel not to death but to live as himself, knowing his own cowardice, referencing Daniel's failure to act when Upnor murdered a Puritan at Trinity College years earlier. After being dumped in the wasteland between Westminster and Chelsea, Daniel removes the collar and makes his way to Sterling's construction site, where a porter helps him reach Gresham's College by dawn. There he finds a coded letter from Eliza using binary notation hidden in her handwriting style. Using the I Ching hexagram 19 (binary 000011 = decimal 3) as the decryption key, he decodes her message revealing "I AM COMING." The letter details her travel plans and intentions to visit London. Daniel realizes she expects to move in court circles at Whitehall Palace, likely timing her visit to coincide with important political events.

Daniel continues decoding Eliza's letter in the Royal Society's library, learning her detailed travel plans. At the coffee house, he encounters Nicolas Fatio de Duilliers, the Swiss mathematician who saved William of Orange from French assassination. Fatio has taken refuge in London after his life became forfeit on the Continent for betraying French plots. He's been given free access to Gresham's College by Newton, and Daniel notices Fatio's unnaturally penetrating gaze examining his neck wounds. Meanwhile, Daniel suffers from what appears to be kidney stones or bladder problems, struggling to urinate and producing rust-colored urine. While relieving himself, he calculates the timing of Eliza's arrival against other significant events: the King's new Declaration of Indulgence (which would make Daniel temporarily popular among Nonconformists) and Queen Mary's pregnancy. He realizes Eliza is timing her visit for late May/early June to coincide with the Queen's delivery—she wants insider access to determine whether King James II produces a legitimate male heir, crucial information for her financial investments.

Daniel completes Eliza's coded message, which reveals her travel plans and expectation to visit Whitehall Palace during Queen Mary's delivery. As a Versailles courtier, she would be welcomed by the Catholic Francophiles at James II's court eager to see French fashions. Daniel realizes this is purely mercenary—Eliza needs early intelligence about whether the King produces a legitimate heir to adjust her investments accordingly. The narrative then shifts to July 1688, with Eliza writing to d'Avaux from Versailles using a new cipher (suspecting the Dutch broke their old code). She reports successful investments despite volatile V.O.C. stock performance, particularly profiting from London commodity trading in silver and gold due to England's debased coinage and counterfeiting problems. She describes seducing Daniel to gain Whitehall access during the Queen's labor, mentioning "peculiarities" about the infant's delivery she'll reveal later. Eliza details London's financial evolution, particularly Lloyd's Coffee House becoming the center for maritime insurance underwriting, where buyers and sellers spontaneously form risk-sharing associations—a fascinating development she's profitably exploited through her connections to the Waterhouse family's banking network.
