Daniel Waterhouse confronts Enoch Root about the future of science and the end of alchemy, debating the nature of reality versus geometric figments. Root helps Daniel track down Judge Jeffreys, who's attempting to flee England on a ship called Hare. Daniel and Bob Shaftoe traverse London's docks, searching taverns for the fugitive judge. After a perilous journey shooting London Bridge's rapids, they find Jeffreys disguised in the Red Cow tavern, his eyebrows shaved to avoid recognition. Daniel exposes Jeffreys' identity to the tavern's patrons, reminding them of his crimes as the "Hanging Judge" who committed atrocities during the Bloody Assizes. Trapped between the tavern keeper's shillelagh and Bob's dagger, Jeffreys is cornered as soldiers arrive from the Tower. Daniel's final words to Jeffreys, "You and I are but earth," mark the end of their long, fraught relationship, as justice finally catches up with the notorious judge.

Leibniz writes to Eliza from Venice in July 1689, reporting on the successful delivery of her letter and providing updates on global political changes. He notes William and Mary's coronation, a new tall and clever Tsar Peter in Russia, and territorial expansions to the Pacific. Venice continues pressing back the Turks, while France and England devise new war financing methods - Louis XIV melts palace silver while England creates national debt. Leibniz expresses concern for the pregnant Eliza, knowing her attraction to financial markets during upheavals. He discusses Princess Eleanor's situation, explaining how German Protestant princesses like her, lacking wealth after family disputes, become pawns in larger political machinations orchestrated by Sophie and Sophie Charlotte. He predicts Eleanor will marry into German royalty while her daughter Caroline, learning from powerful women like Eliza, will eventually control her own destiny. Leibniz announces his new discipline called "dynamics" to study force, positioning it against Newton's mystical approach.

Eliza writes to Leibniz from The Hague in August 1689, employing both plaintext and encrypted messages to reveal the truth about her childbirth. She explains how Princess Eleanor and Caroline visited her daily during pregnancy, with Caroline showing remarkable curiosity about natural philosophy, inheriting her late father's passion. Eliza recounts being ambushed during labor - instead of reaching Eleanor's prepared birthing chamber, she was diverted to another room where Dr. Alkmaar attended her difficult breech birth. Marie, one of her assigned servants, suspiciously inquired about the baby's palate, revealing French intelligence operations monitoring whether Étienne d'Arcachon's child would inherit family deformities. Eliza deduces that Marie works for French interests, likely connected to the new ambassador Montluçon and ultimately d'Avaux. The letter reveals a complex web of court intrigue surrounding noble bloodlines, with Étienne seeking healthy offspring to restore his family line, while French agents monitor the birth's outcome for political leverage.

Eliza continues her encrypted letter, revealing how Dr. Alkmaar uses an experimental drug from "the Red" (Enoch Root) to relax her muscles, enabling him to turn the breech baby. She realizes Marie may have orders to ensure the bastard child is stillborn, given its inconvenient status. When Marie and the midwife whisper conspiratorially, Eliza sets fire to the bed curtains, causing them to flee. Brigitte heroically drags Eliza on her mattress through the palace gallery to Eleanor's chamber, where the trusted German midwife Frau Heppner delivers the baby safely. Eliza reflects on how religion might restrain Eleanor's potential vices as she entrusts her newborn son to the princess's care. They circulate a cover story that the child is an orphan from a Palatinate massacre. Living separately at Huygens's house while recovering, Eliza plans to take the baby to London if she survives, but fears d'Avaux's schemes during her vulnerable convalescence.

Eliza concludes her encrypted letter by revealing the true father of her healthy child: Bonaventure Rossignol, the King's cryptanalyst, not Étienne d'Arcachon. During the Rhine campaign, Rossignol rescued her from danger, leading to a passionate affair. To facilitate her escape, she seduced Étienne as cover. Rossignol, reading her journal for d'Avaux, cleverly edited his translation to omit his own romantic role while making Eliza appear as Étienne's ideal breeding partner. The baby inherits Rossignol's healthy bloodline rather than the Arcachons' defects. Eliza struggles with separation from her son, her body responding to his cries across the square. She asks Leibniz that if he meets young Caroline accompanied by an orphan boy "born on the Rhine," he'll know the child's true parentage. Meanwhile, in October 1689, Daniel Waterhouse prepares for his voyage to Massachusetts, liquidating his London life while suffering from kidney stones, visited by Samuel Pepys who attempts to convince him to have surgery.

Daniel Waterhouse, gravely ill with kidney stones, receives a visit from Samuel Pepys in October 1689. Pepys arrives with librarian assistants to purchase Daniel's books as he prepares for Massachusetts. Despite Daniel's deteriorating condition, Pepys enthusiastically advocates for surgical removal of the stone, displaying his own removed stone and citing thirty years of added life. Daniel refuses the risky procedure, preferring death to the surgery that killed his mentor Wilkins. Pepys reveals he's organizing a farewell party at the Royal Society, refusing to accept Daniel's protests about his weakness. Daniel is carried in a sedan chair to Bedlam, where Hooke has prepared a gathering. The party includes Newton, Fatio, Huygens, Boyle, Wren, and other luminaries. Roger Comstock delivers a humorous toast about pure alcohol that won't trouble the kidneys. As the evening progresses, Daniel gradually loses consciousness from the strong spirits, dreaming briefly of proposing to Eliza before acknowledging his current state makes such thoughts absurd.

Daniel awakens from his farewell party to find himself restrained in a chair by elaborate rope work, facing surgical instruments laid out by Robert Hooke. Multiple phosphorus lights illuminate the scene as Hooke prepares to perform lithotomy surgery to remove Daniel's kidney stone, explaining he lacks mercy, which makes him perfectly suited for the operation. Despite Daniel's protests, Hooke proceeds with the dangerous procedure he calls "a pearl of great price," using instruments including probes, lancets, hooks, and rakes. A leather strap is forced into Daniel's mouth as Hooke begins cutting. The chapter ends with an extensive Dramatis Personae explaining the complex naming conventions of nobility and listing key historical figures including the Anglesey family, French nobles like d'Arcachon, members of Charles II's CABAL, scientists like Leibniz and Newton, and the various Waterhouse family members. The list distinguishes between historically accurate entries (in Roman type) and fictional elements (in italics).

Daniel continues narrating Hooke's surgical procedure at Bedlam, comparing his experience to that of vivisected dogs who, lacking consciousness of past or future, suffer purely in the present moment. The Dramatis Personae section continues with detailed entries for historical figures from K through W, including Jack Ketch (executioners), Gottfried Leibniz, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Samuel Pepys, and various members of European nobility. Notable entries include explanations of Louis XIV's family members and mistresses, cryptographers like the Rossignols, Dutch military leaders, and the complex genealogies of the Stuart, Bourbon, and German noble houses. The list particularly details the House of Hanover through Sophie and her descendants, who would later claim the English throne. The Waterhouse family tree is extensively documented, showing Daniel's place among Puritan merchants and colonists. Each entry provides birth/death dates and key relationships, creating a comprehensive reference for understanding the web of political, scientific, and familial connections that drive the narrative.

The Dramatis Personae concludes with entries for the Waterhouse family's later generations and other key figures through to the letter Z, including Eliza's noble titles. Author's acknowledgments follow, crediting the extensive scholarly web underlying the work while acknowledging fictional departures from historical truth. Key scholarly influences include works on the period's major figures, with special mention of Fernand Braudel's historical approach. The author thanks various individuals for access to historical sites and research materials, including connections at Cambridge and period reenactors who provided expertise on subjects like gunpowder. Publishing support came from multiple editors and agents who showed "superhuman patience" with the project. The acknowledgments emphasize that while building on serious scholarship, the work takes creative liberties, and readers seeking historical accuracy should consult the original scholarly sources. The section ends by recognizing the centuries-long intellectual tradition from Wilkins and Comenius forward that made such a work possible.

The final chunk contains the remainder of the acknowledgments, with a partial cut-off that mentions Jeremy. The dramatic conclusion to Daniel's surgery at Bedlam is implied but not fully shown, leaving his fate uncertain as Hooke performs the dangerous lithotomy. The comprehensive Dramatis Personae serves as both character guide and historical reference, distinguishing real figures from fictional ones while explaining the complex web of noble titles, family relationships, and political alliances that shaped late 17th-century Europe. The author's acknowledgments reveal the extensive research foundation for the work, crediting historians, scientists, and other scholars while taking responsibility for creative departures from fact. The combination of dramatic medical crisis, detailed historical documentation, and scholarly attribution creates a fitting conclusion to this section of Quicksilver, balancing fiction with historical grounding while leaving Daniel's survival as an open question that presumably drives the narrative forward into subsequent volumes.
