In October 1713, Enoch the Red arrives in Boston just as a witch is being hanged
on the Common. The execution is conducted with Puritan efficiency, lacking the
spectacle of London hangings. Enoch, a mysterious traveler with silver hair,
copper beard, and an arsenal including pistols and alchemical instruments,
observes the city's defenses and fears. After the hanging, he explores Boston's
rebuilt streets (following a great fire), noting its numerous small churches and
strong harbor fortifications. At a tavern frequented by sea merchants, he
searches unsuccessfully for Captain van Hoek. While leading his horse through
the narrow streets near a tallow-chandlery, he encounters a precocious eight-
year-old boy who has skipped school to avoid the hanging. The boy questions
Enoch about Europe versus Christendom, displaying both intelligence and social
awkwardness. Their conversation reveals the boy's advanced learning and sets up
what appears to be a significant meeting between the mysterious alchemist and
this unusual child.

Ben, son of Josiah the tallow-chandler, reveals himself as a remarkably educated
eight-year-old who engages Enoch Root in sophisticated discourse about global
politics and religious conflicts. They discuss the recently concluded War of
Spanish Succession, the Peace of Utrecht, and the Asiento slave trade agreement.
Enoch teaches Ben about the Islamic world's division of territories and traces
English political history from Archbishop Laud's persecution of Puritans through
the Civil War, Charles I's execution, and the Restoration. Enoch seeks a man
who, as a small child, witnessed Charles I's beheading while sitting on his
father Drake's shoulders—Drake having been mutilated by Archbishop Laud for his
anti-royalist agitation. Refusing to reveal the family name, Enoch asks Ben to
guide him to the Charlestown ferry. At the wharf, Enoch pays their passage with
Spanish silver (the only currency in circulation) and spots his ship Minerva,
recognizing her by the carved figurehead of the goddess, ready to depart.

On the Charlestown ferry, Enoch observes a Barker attempting to incite an
Angolan slave to rebellion while Ben questions him about his fine borrowed
horse. Enoch explains he received sanctuary during a slave revolt in New York
and borrowed the horse from a fellow member of the Royal Society of London who
hadn't paid his dues. Ben, impressed by the mention of Natural Philosophy,
declares his ambition to become a Fellow and Judge. The ferry navigates past
logs marked with the King's Arrow while Enoch encounters Harvard scholars who
mock his destination—Daniel Waterhouse. They derisively call him the "Doctor of
Cranks," describing his Massachusetts Bay Colony Institute of Technologickal
Arts as a tiny, gear-filled enterprise powered by young Ben Franklin. The
scholars clearly view Waterhouse's technological pursuits as inferior to their
classical learning, revealing the tension between traditional academia and
practical innovation. Enoch learns the Institute lies midway between Charlestown
and Harvard, identifiable by the sound of grinding gears.

The ferry arrives at Charlestown, where Harvard professors eagerly examine a
sealed letter Enoch carries for Dr. Waterhouse. The seal bears marks from
Hanover and Ansbach, causing the academics to bow obsequiously, anticipating
Queen Anne's death and the Hanoverian succession. Ben guides Enoch away from the
pursuing professors into the countryside, where they collect Godfrey Waterhouse,
Daniel's younger son named after Leibniz. As they journey toward Daniel's
Institute, Enoch tells the boys about his past as an alchemical supplier in the
1650s, traveling from Leipzig to visit Mr. Clarke, an apothecary in Grantham,
Lincolnshire. He explains how Cromwell's Navigation Act and war against the
Dutch forced him to travel via Paris, where exiled English Cavaliers—including
the future Charles II—maintained alchemical laboratories to pass their time. The
boys learn that before the Royal Society and Natural Philosophy, alchemy was the
primary pursuit of those curious about nature's workings.

Enoch continues his tale, describing his 1654 visit to Paris for Louis XIV's
coronation and to see Huygens's revolutionary pendulum clock in the
Hague—marking the dawn of precise timekeeping and Natural Philosophy's beginning
in 1655. He explains how he smuggled alchemical supplies to England via French
salt-smugglers, visiting Oxford where John Wilkins hosted the Experimental
Philosophical Club (featuring Wren, Boyle, and Hooke) and married Cromwell's
sister. Arriving at Clarke's apothecary in Grantham by moonlight, Enoch finds
the yard littered with alchemical debris. Inside, he introduces Clarke to tea
(chai), which the apothecary dismisses as unlikely to catch on with Englishmen.
Enoch delivers sulfur from Italian volcanoes, antimony, quicksilver, and
alchemical texts, serving as a messenger between Continental and English
alchemists all seeking the Philosophick Mercury—the key to transmutation and
immortality. Mrs. Clarke serves porridge to many children while Enoch and Clarke
discuss years of alchemical developments since the Civil War.

Enoch notices a fair-haired boy among Clarke's boarders who shows exceptional
observational skills and craftsmanship. The boy has created intricate furniture
for his sister's dollhouse and woven a complex net around a stone. His room
reveals sophisticated drawings, dissected animal hearts, and attempts to build
perpetual motion machines. After witnessing the boy use his weighted string to
retrieve an apple for an ungrateful older boy, Enoch follows them to school
where a vicious fight ensues. The smaller boy brutally defeats his tormentor,
grinding his face against the church wall until a schoolmaster intervenes with a
cane. Enoch discovers the boy has been inscribing "I. NEWTON" throughout the
school and is now being punished by erasing his own name. Recognizing the boy's
extraordinary potential, Enoch advises Clarke to expose him to mathematics and
let him pursue his own path rather than forcing him toward alchemy.

In October 1713, Enoch arrives at Daniel Waterhouse's Massachusetts Bay Colony
Institute of Technologickal Arts, finding the elderly scientist surrounded by
thousands of index cards marked with binary numbers and concepts. Daniel
explains his system: prime numbers for simple concepts (monads) and products of
primes for composite ideas, creating a multi-dimensional knowledge organization
system. The Institute disappoints Daniel's expectations—lacking students or
protégés, with mechanically talented youth more interested in steam engines than
his Logic Mill using pushrods instead of Leibniz's ball-and-trough design. Enoch
delivers a letter from Princess Caroline and discusses the bitter priority
dispute between Newton and Leibniz that has poisoned scientific discourse across
Europe. Daniel appears isolated, his work unappreciated in a colony where
association with Leibniz carries stigma. Despite setbacks, he continues
developing his computational device while lamenting how modern students are
overwhelmed by proliferating scientific disciplines, unlike his simpler days
studying prisms with Isaac Newton at Sturbridge Fair.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 8: Words 14001-16000
----------------------------
Word count: 153

Enoch warns Daniel about the vicious turn in the Newton-Leibniz priority
dispute, with anonymous attacks, planted reviews, and challenge problems
reducing great minds to pawns. Daniel dismisses concerns about his isolation
being linked to Leibniz's reputation. They discuss Princess Caroline's
request—likely the same computational work Daniel has always done. The
conversation reveals Daniel's disappointment: he'd hoped to create something
like Gresham's College at Harvard but found no interested students for his Logic
Mill. Enoch observes Daniel's well-preserved mental acuity despite his aged
appearance—bald, hawk-nosed, with large staring eyes that take in more than his
slot-like mouth reveals. Daniel's workspace combines mechanical tools with his
vast card index system, each card assigned unique numbers based on prime
factorization to represent the relationships between concepts. The visit
represents another attempt to draw Daniel back into European scientific circles
despite his contentment with colonial obscurity and his revolutionary
information organization system.

At a tavern near Cambridge, Daniel and Enoch discuss their situation while Irish
music plays in the background. Daniel reveals his father Drake raised him solely
to greet Christ's return in 1666, educating him in classical languages for the
Apocalypse. After witnessing Hugh Peters's execution, Drake took fourteen-year-
old Daniel to meet John Wilkins at Trinity College, Cambridge. Instead of
religious instruction, Wilkins showed Daniel his collection of cryptographic
texts from around the world—gathered after publishing his Cryptonomicon—and they
accidentally set fire to a table while reproducing Boyle's experiments. Wilkins
secretly steered Daniel toward natural philosophy at Gresham's College rather
than theology. Years later, Daniel reads Princess Caroline's letter offering
substantial insurance for a voyage to London—enough to provide for his wife and
son. Despite recognizing it as a "posthumous bribe," Daniel realizes he will
soon sail for London, though he's hours from admitting it. The tavern fills with
curious locals treating their meeting as public entertainment.

SUMMARY 10: Words 18001-20000
-----------------------------
Word count: 155

Enoch urges Daniel to return to England, arguing that natural philosophy is best
done by young men and the revolution needs healing at its core. The Newton-
Leibniz schism threatens to divide British and Continental philosophy, with
Britain having more to lose. Daniel's memories of Trinity College emerge like
gold nuggets panned from muddy water over fifty years: his father Drake
demolishing a cathedral's stained glass, the Barkers' iconoclasm, and his
arrival at Trinity after the Restoration. His first night there, he witnesses
the Duke of Monmouth's scarlet-clad companion kill a black-clothed Puritan who
tried to bar wenches from entering. Daniel follows the blood trail to find Roger
Comstock and Jeffreys naked by the river, claiming they pursued the "wounded
man." Jeffreys manipulates the narrative, insisting no murder occurred. This
nugget of memory—the casual violence of Cavaliers against Puritans—exemplifies
Daniel's chaotic introduction to post-Restoration Cambridge.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 11: Words 20001-22000
-----------------------------
Word count: 152

Daniel recalls his troubled nights at Trinity, where drunken, dangerous
roommates fractured his sleep. Roger Comstock, claiming to be from the "Golden"
not "Silver" branch of his family, reveals his Amsterdam-influenced religious
relativism—"a Babel of religious disputation" in his head. After Upnor's assault
on the Puritan, Jeffreys leads Daniel to the Justice of the Peace's house, but
finding him at church, they go to an alehouse instead. While Jeffreys drinks
heavily and consorts with wenches, Daniel sits paralyzed by fear of being
murdered. He rationalizes not reporting the crime: England is now Babylon, Upnor
will be judged when Christ returns in 1666, and secular justice is pointless.
The murdered Fellow of Trinity, a Hebrew scholar acquainted with Drake, is found
in the Cam two days later. At the funeral in a barn church exactly five miles
from Cambridge (per the Act of Uniformity), Drake approves of Daniel's trials as
tests of faith.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 12: Words 22001-24000
-----------------------------
Word count: 156

Daniel's brothers Raleigh and Sterling scold him for not appreciating his
Cambridge opportunities, viewing proximity to nobility like Monmouth as the
whole point of their expensive investment. Jeffreys torments Daniel afterwards,
calling him a "Platonic ideal of cowardice" and suggesting he's created a
"Massachusetts of the mind" to escape reality. He mocks Daniel as living at
Trinity bodily while his spirit dwells in an imaginary Puritan Plymouth. Roger
Comstock continues distinguishing himself from John Comstock, the Lord
Chancellor who authored the Act of Uniformity, claiming the Silver Comstocks
supplied faulty gunpowder that caused the Cavaliers' defeat. The Golden
Comstocks' Dutch experience has made Roger theologically flexible, hosting
multiple faiths arguing in his head. Jeffreys, studying law, uses justice's
scales metaphor to position Daniel as the standard weight against which all
cowards will be measured. This harassment drives Daniel to spend more time
walking Cambridge's gardens, avoiding both his tormentor and his conscience
about the unavenged murder.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 13: Words 24001-26000
-----------------------------
Word count: 154

Fleeing Jeffreys's torments, Daniel walks Cambridge's gardens where he
encounters another solitary figure—a pale, frail sizar with fair hair already
streaked with silver. Isaac Newton and Daniel, both alienated Puritans
interested in natural philosophy, become roommates after arranging a swap.
Despite Isaac's brilliance, he continues performing sizar duties for Daniel, who
proposes they live as equals but is refused. Daniel discovers Isaac has drawn an
idealized portrait of him as an angelic youth. On Whitsunday, Isaac experiences
a spiritual crisis, praying desperately in the chapel before taking communion.
He then catalogs all his past sins but leaves the "Since Whitsunday 1662" page
blank—Daniel later realizes Isaac has stopped believing himself capable of sin.
In 1713 Boston, Daniel discusses his departure with Faith and Wait Still
Waterhouse (a Free Will preacher), arguing his mind is a deterministic machine.
He believes leaving will create a better fantasy father for Godfrey than his
flawed reality could provide.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 14: Words 26001-28000
-----------------------------
Word count: 159

Daniel debates theology with Wait Still, rejecting Free Will in favor of
mechanistic predestination based on Natural Philosophy rather than Calvinism. He
compares souls to alchemical Quintessence—something Newton has sought without
success. Faith wears a caduceus hairpin and blushes when Daniel suggests Wait
Still will raise Godfrey, implying romantic interest. Daniel argues his
departure will give Godfrey an idealized phantom father rather than a flawed
real one. At the wharf, slaves row him to Minerva through Boston Harbor, passing
pirate corpses in gibbets on tidal islands—a grim honor guard for his departure.
The slaves sing a strange African-Irish lament that reminds each of their own
capture and transport. Daniel weeps as he leaves, while Mrs. Goose memorizes
events for posterity and Enoch remains to shape the story. The ascent up
Minerva's ladder becomes a Puritan allegory—Jacob's ladder from earthly slaves
to heavenly ship. Lascars haul him aboard as Atlantic rollers rock the vessel
like a mother's breathing bosom.

In 1663 Cambridge, Daniel finds Isaac conducting a horrifying
experiment—inserting a blunt darning needle between his eyeball and socket to
distort the eye's shape and study optics. While Daniel holds up measured
reticules, Isaac manipulates the needle and records observations,
revolutionizing understanding of vision and sensory perception. By sunrise,
Newton knows more about the human eye than anyone ever has. The experiment
demonstrates how observations are distorted by the instruments (including eyes)
used to make them, challenging Boyle's color theories. During chapel, Daniel
experiences an epiphany about perception as his exhausted mind processes the
implications. Aboard Minerva in 1713, Captain van Hoek (a stubby red-headed
Dutchman) shows Daniel to his cabin. The ship moves silently compared to the
slaves' boat, harmonizing with natural forces. Daniel reflects on how his failed
moral test at Trinity freed him to pursue Natural Philosophy despite inevitable
damnation, filling his remaining years with something interesting before his
predestined arrival at Hell's gates.

Daniel wakes aboard Minerva to sunlight streaming through the great wheel,
dividing the sun into sectors like a misguided sundial. This recalls Isaac's
Trinity sundial project—plotting daily shadow curves through seasons to
understand planetary motion. When Daniel asks why sundials fascinate him, Isaac
flees to Jesus Green at night, explaining under moonlight that heavenly rays
contain God's cryptographic messages. The gnomon ("We are gnomon") interrupts
light, casting informative shadows. Recording these reveals partial knowledge
from the divine cryptogram. Isaac wants to predict shadow positions on any
surface, even Saturn's moon—a project with implications for souls, free will,
and whether the world improves or decays toward apocalypse. Aboard Minerva,
Daniel sees nature's perfection: straight horizons, orderly solar progression.
The ship embodies Leibniz-curves navigating by Bernoulli-rules across Newton's
calculated sphere. Daniel envisions shipwreck as a five-act opera progressing
from calm sailing through storm, destruction, and feral survival—humanity's
normal state throughout history.

SUMMARY 17: Words 32001-34000
-----------------------------

Daniel reflects that his generation was born into chaos (Act V) and raised in
Act IV, while Newton dwelt in a personal bubble of Act II, progressing toward
Act I's perfect order. Cambridge authorities believed the opposite—that the
world had declined from Eden through classical Athens to present decay. Newton
and Daniel prepared for geometry exams while Newton secretly advanced Cartesian
analysis beyond his teachers' comprehension. They consulted Isaac Barrow (who'd
fought pirates), and Newton translated Euclid into algebra in microscopic
marginalia. After receiving their scholarships in 1665, they walk to Stourbridge
Fair along the Cam. Newton explains his theory of fluxions using a punt's
movement along the river's S-curve as example—the changing directional flow over
time. He applies the same analysis to river weeds bent by current, arguing that
translating things into analytical language reveals underlying sameness beneath
superficial differences, like alchemists extracting pure spirits from gross
matter. This mathematical approach frees natural philosophers from Aristotelian
constraints about mixing different natures.

Approaching Stourbridge Fair, Europe's largest, Daniel and Isaac encounter boats
loaded with traders, Gypsies, and merchants. The fair sprawls larger than
Cambridge—a chaos of rope-dancers, puppeteers, prostitutes, and merchants from
across Europe. Isaac, adopting Puritan posture, navigates to a Jewish lens-
grinder's display of prisms and optical equipment. A complex haggling ensues
over two prisms, revealing England's monetary chaos: old hammered coins versus
new milled ones, widespread clipping and counterfeiting, and the export of good
silver to the Orient. The lens-grinder, claiming to be from London via Poland
(not Spain), refuses their Elizabethan and Edwardian shillings as debased or
clipped. Daniel and Isaac present increasingly dubious coins with elaborate
provenances—found at Naseby, obtained from drunken dukes—while discussing the
Great Debasement, Gresham's reforms, and monastery wealth. The Jew tests coins
by biting them, declaring most worthless. This seemingly simple transaction
becomes a dissertation on English coinage's degradation, foreshadowing Newton's
later role as Master of the Mint. EOF < /dev/null

Enoch continues his tale to the boys, explaining how he witnessed Louis XIV's
coronation in 1654 and visited Christian Huygens, who had invented the first
true pendulum clock—marking the beginning of "the Time of Natural Philosophy" in
1655. He describes visiting Oxford's Experimental Philosophical Club, where
figures like Christopher Wren, Robert Boyle, and Robert Hooke met weekly in John
Wilkins's chambers at Wadham College. Wilkins had married Cromwell's sister as
his "sacrifice" for Natural Philosophy. Enoch then traveled to Grantham to visit
Mr. Clarke, an apothecary eager for alchemical supplies and knowledge. He
brought exotic materials—sulfur from Italian volcanoes, antimony,
quicksilver—and introduced Clarke to tea (cha/chai/tay), which Clarke found
pleasant but doubted would catch on in England. Their meeting was more about
exchanging alchemical knowledge than commerce, as European alchemists anxiously
wondered if English practitioners had discovered the Philosophick Mercury, the
key to transmutation and immortality. Clarke's household had grown considerably
since Enoch's last visit. EOF < /dev/null

At Clarke's house in Grantham, Enoch observes local children through a window,
noticing one fair-haired boy who has cleverly woven a net around a stone to help
retrieve apples from trees. The boy generously gives the apple to a taller boy
he clearly admires, only to be mocked and bullied for his artistic nature—making
doll furniture and painting. A brutal fight ensues where the smaller boy
viciously attacks his tormentor, grinding his face against the church wall until
a schoolmaster intervenes with a cane. Investigating further, Enoch explores the
children's boarding room upstairs, finding walls covered with charcoal drawings.
The fair-haired boy's artwork shows exceptional observational skills and
precision, including mechanical drawings, plant-based paints, furniture made
from grass and twigs, and attempts at portraiture. The room reveals a brilliant,
creative mind trapped among ordinary children who cannot appreciate his gifts.
Enoch recognizes the boy possesses both remarkable talent and the dangerous
passion that often accompanies it. EOF < /dev/null

SUMMARY 7: Words 12001-14000

Enoch discovers the fair-haired boy has been dissecting rats and birds to study
their hearts, attempting to understand perpetual motion. Clarke reveals he
deliberately recruited the boy, whose father is absent, believing he could be
"the one" to achieve alchemical greatness. Enoch disagrees, predicting the boy
will become a great empiricist but warning against steering him solely toward
alchemy. He describes young prodigies like six-year-old Gottfried in Leipzig
(who taught himself Latin and Greek), and Huygens's pendulum clock that
perfectly measures time. Enoch advocates for the new natural philosophy emerging
from Descartes and others, urging Clarke to expose the boy to mathematics,
particularly Euclid. As punishment, the boy—revealed as I.
NEWTON—enthusiastically scrubs his name from the school's surfaces. The
narrative jumps to 1713 Massachusetts, where Enoch visits Daniel Waterhouse at
his Institute. He finds Waterhouse surrounded by thousands of cards marked with
numbers in binary notation and corresponding concepts, representing Leibniz's
system of organizing all knowledge through prime number multiplication. EOF <
