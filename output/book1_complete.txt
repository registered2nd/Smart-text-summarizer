In October 1713, Enoch the Red arrives in Boston just as a witch is being hanged
on the Common. The execution is conducted with Puritan efficiency, lacking the
spectacle of London hangings. Enoch, a mysterious traveler with silver hair,
copper beard, and an arsenal including pistols and alchemical instruments,
observes the city's defenses and fears. After the hanging, he explores Boston's
rebuilt streets (following a great fire), noting its numerous small churches and
strong harbor fortifications. At a tavern frequented by sea merchants, he
searches unsuccessfully for Captain van Hoek. While leading his horse through
the narrow streets near a tallow-chandlery, he encounters a precocious eight-
year-old boy who has skipped school to avoid the hanging. The boy questions
Enoch about Europe versus Christendom, displaying both intelligence and social
awkwardness. Their conversation reveals the boy's advanced learning and sets up
what appears to be a significant meeting between the mysterious alchemist and
this unusual child.

Ben, son of Josiah the tallow-chandler, reveals himself as a remarkably educated
eight-year-old who engages Enoch Root in sophisticated discourse about global
politics and religious conflicts. They discuss the recently concluded War of
Spanish Succession, the Peace of Utrecht, and the Asiento slave trade agreement.
Enoch teaches Ben about the Islamic world's division of territories and traces
English political history from Archbishop Laud's persecution of Puritans through
the Civil War, Charles I's execution, and the Restoration. Enoch seeks a man
who, as a small child, witnessed Charles I's beheading while sitting on his
father Drake's shoulders—Drake having been mutilated by Archbishop Laud for his
anti-royalist agitation. Refusing to reveal the family name, Enoch asks Ben to
guide him to the Charlestown ferry. At the wharf, Enoch pays their passage with
Spanish silver (the only currency in circulation) and spots his ship Minerva,
recognizing her by the carved figurehead of the goddess, ready to depart.

On the Charlestown ferry, Enoch observes a Barker attempting to incite an
Angolan slave to rebellion while Ben questions him about his fine borrowed
horse. Enoch explains he received sanctuary during a slave revolt in New York
and borrowed the horse from a fellow member of the Royal Society of London who
hadn't paid his dues. Ben, impressed by the mention of Natural Philosophy,
declares his ambition to become a Fellow and Judge. The ferry navigates past
logs marked with the King's Arrow while Enoch encounters Harvard scholars who
mock his destination—Daniel Waterhouse. They derisively call him the "Doctor of
Cranks," describing his Massachusetts Bay Colony Institute of Technologickal
Arts as a tiny, gear-filled enterprise powered by young Ben Franklin. The
scholars clearly view Waterhouse's technological pursuits as inferior to their
classical learning, revealing the tension between traditional academia and
practical innovation. Enoch learns the Institute lies midway between Charlestown
and Harvard, identifiable by the sound of grinding gears.

The ferry arrives at Charlestown, where Harvard professors eagerly examine a
sealed letter Enoch carries for Dr. Waterhouse. The seal bears marks from
Hanover and Ansbach, causing the academics to bow obsequiously, anticipating
Queen Anne's death and the Hanoverian succession. Ben guides Enoch away from the
pursuing professors into the countryside, where they collect Godfrey Waterhouse,
Daniel's younger son named after Leibniz. As they journey toward Daniel's
Institute, Enoch tells the boys about his past as an alchemical supplier in the
1650s, traveling from Leipzig to visit Mr. Clarke, an apothecary in Grantham,
Lincolnshire. He explains how Cromwell's Navigation Act and war against the
Dutch forced him to travel via Paris, where exiled English Cavaliers—including
the future Charles II—maintained alchemical laboratories to pass their time. The
boys learn that before the Royal Society and Natural Philosophy, alchemy was the
primary pursuit of those curious about nature's workings.

Enoch continues his tale, describing his 1654 visit to Paris for Louis XIV's
coronation and to see Huygens's revolutionary pendulum clock in the
Hague—marking the dawn of precise timekeeping and Natural Philosophy's beginning
in 1655. He explains how he smuggled alchemical supplies to England via French
salt-smugglers, visiting Oxford where John Wilkins hosted the Experimental
Philosophical Club (featuring Wren, Boyle, and Hooke) and married Cromwell's
sister. Arriving at Clarke's apothecary in Grantham by moonlight, Enoch finds
the yard littered with alchemical debris. Inside, he introduces Clarke to tea
(chai), which the apothecary dismisses as unlikely to catch on with Englishmen.
Enoch delivers sulfur from Italian volcanoes, antimony, quicksilver, and
alchemical texts, serving as a messenger between Continental and English
alchemists all seeking the Philosophick Mercury—the key to transmutation and
immortality. Mrs. Clarke serves porridge to many children while Enoch and Clarke
discuss years of alchemical developments since the Civil War.

Enoch notices a fair-haired boy among Clarke's boarders who shows exceptional
observational skills and craftsmanship. The boy has created intricate furniture
for his sister's dollhouse and woven a complex net around a stone. His room
reveals sophisticated drawings, dissected animal hearts, and attempts to build
perpetual motion machines. After witnessing the boy use his weighted string to
retrieve an apple for an ungrateful older boy, Enoch follows them to school
where a vicious fight ensues. The smaller boy brutally defeats his tormentor,
grinding his face against the church wall until a schoolmaster intervenes with a
cane. Enoch discovers the boy has been inscribing "I. NEWTON" throughout the
school and is now being punished by erasing his own name. Recognizing the boy's
extraordinary potential, Enoch advises Clarke to expose him to mathematics and
let him pursue his own path rather than forcing him toward alchemy.

In October 1713, Enoch arrives at Daniel Waterhouse's Massachusetts Bay Colony
Institute of Technologickal Arts, finding the elderly scientist surrounded by
thousands of index cards marked with binary numbers and concepts. Daniel
explains his system: prime numbers for simple concepts (monads) and products of
primes for composite ideas, creating a multi-dimensional knowledge organization
system. The Institute disappoints Daniel's expectations—lacking students or
protégés, with mechanically talented youth more interested in steam engines than
his Logic Mill using pushrods instead of Leibniz's ball-and-trough design. Enoch
delivers a letter from Princess Caroline and discusses the bitter priority
dispute between Newton and Leibniz that has poisoned scientific discourse across
Europe. Daniel appears isolated, his work unappreciated in a colony where
association with Leibniz carries stigma. Despite setbacks, he continues
developing his computational device while lamenting how modern students are
overwhelmed by proliferating scientific disciplines, unlike his simpler days
studying prisms with Isaac Newton at Sturbridge Fair.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 8: Words 14001-16000
----------------------------
Word count: 153

Enoch warns Daniel about the vicious turn in the Newton-Leibniz priority
dispute, with anonymous attacks, planted reviews, and challenge problems
reducing great minds to pawns. Daniel dismisses concerns about his isolation
being linked to Leibniz's reputation. They discuss Princess Caroline's
request—likely the same computational work Daniel has always done. The
conversation reveals Daniel's disappointment: he'd hoped to create something
like Gresham's College at Harvard but found no interested students for his Logic
Mill. Enoch observes Daniel's well-preserved mental acuity despite his aged
appearance—bald, hawk-nosed, with large staring eyes that take in more than his
slot-like mouth reveals. Daniel's workspace combines mechanical tools with his
vast card index system, each card assigned unique numbers based on prime
factorization to represent the relationships between concepts. The visit
represents another attempt to draw Daniel back into European scientific circles
despite his contentment with colonial obscurity and his revolutionary
information organization system.

At a tavern near Cambridge, Daniel and Enoch discuss their situation while Irish
music plays in the background. Daniel reveals his father Drake raised him solely
to greet Christ's return in 1666, educating him in classical languages for the
Apocalypse. After witnessing Hugh Peters's execution, Drake took fourteen-year-
old Daniel to meet John Wilkins at Trinity College, Cambridge. Instead of
religious instruction, Wilkins showed Daniel his collection of cryptographic
texts from around the world—gathered after publishing his Cryptonomicon—and they
accidentally set fire to a table while reproducing Boyle's experiments. Wilkins
secretly steered Daniel toward natural philosophy at Gresham's College rather
than theology. Years later, Daniel reads Princess Caroline's letter offering
substantial insurance for a voyage to London—enough to provide for his wife and
son. Despite recognizing it as a "posthumous bribe," Daniel realizes he will
soon sail for London, though he's hours from admitting it. The tavern fills with
curious locals treating their meeting as public entertainment.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 10: Words 18001-20000
-----------------------------
Word count: 155

Enoch urges Daniel to return to England, arguing that natural philosophy is best
done by young men and the revolution needs healing at its core. The Newton-
Leibniz schism threatens to divide British and Continental philosophy, with
Britain having more to lose. Daniel's memories of Trinity College emerge like
gold nuggets panned from muddy water over fifty years: his father Drake
demolishing a cathedral's stained glass, the Barkers' iconoclasm, and his
arrival at Trinity after the Restoration. His first night there, he witnesses
the Duke of Monmouth's scarlet-clad companion kill a black-clothed Puritan who
tried to bar wenches from entering. Daniel follows the blood trail to find Roger
Comstock and Jeffreys naked by the river, claiming they pursued the "wounded
man." Jeffreys manipulates the narrative, insisting no murder occurred. This
nugget of memory—the casual violence of Cavaliers against Puritans—exemplifies
Daniel's chaotic introduction to post-Restoration Cambridge.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 11: Words 20001-22000
-----------------------------
Word count: 152

Daniel recalls his troubled nights at Trinity, where drunken, dangerous
roommates fractured his sleep. Roger Comstock, claiming to be from the "Golden"
not "Silver" branch of his family, reveals his Amsterdam-influenced religious
relativism—"a Babel of religious disputation" in his head. After Upnor's assault
on the Puritan, Jeffreys leads Daniel to the Justice of the Peace's house, but
finding him at church, they go to an alehouse instead. While Jeffreys drinks
heavily and consorts with wenches, Daniel sits paralyzed by fear of being
murdered. He rationalizes not reporting the crime: England is now Babylon, Upnor
will be judged when Christ returns in 1666, and secular justice is pointless.
The murdered Fellow of Trinity, a Hebrew scholar acquainted with Drake, is found
in the Cam two days later. At the funeral in a barn church exactly five miles
from Cambridge (per the Act of Uniformity), Drake approves of Daniel's trials as
tests of faith.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 12: Words 22001-24000
-----------------------------
Word count: 156

Daniel's brothers Raleigh and Sterling scold him for not appreciating his
Cambridge opportunities, viewing proximity to nobility like Monmouth as the
whole point of their expensive investment. Jeffreys torments Daniel afterwards,
calling him a "Platonic ideal of cowardice" and suggesting he's created a
"Massachusetts of the mind" to escape reality. He mocks Daniel as living at
Trinity bodily while his spirit dwells in an imaginary Puritan Plymouth. Roger
Comstock continues distinguishing himself from John Comstock, the Lord
Chancellor who authored the Act of Uniformity, claiming the Silver Comstocks
supplied faulty gunpowder that caused the Cavaliers' defeat. The Golden
Comstocks' Dutch experience has made Roger theologically flexible, hosting
multiple faiths arguing in his head. Jeffreys, studying law, uses justice's
scales metaphor to position Daniel as the standard weight against which all
cowards will be measured. This harassment drives Daniel to spend more time
walking Cambridge's gardens, avoiding both his tormentor and his conscience
about the unavenged murder.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 13: Words 24001-26000
-----------------------------
Word count: 154

Fleeing Jeffreys's torments, Daniel walks Cambridge's gardens where he
encounters another solitary figure—a pale, frail sizar with fair hair already
streaked with silver. Isaac Newton and Daniel, both alienated Puritans
interested in natural philosophy, become roommates after arranging a swap.
Despite Isaac's brilliance, he continues performing sizar duties for Daniel, who
proposes they live as equals but is refused. Daniel discovers Isaac has drawn an
idealized portrait of him as an angelic youth. On Whitsunday, Isaac experiences
a spiritual crisis, praying desperately in the chapel before taking communion.
He then catalogs all his past sins but leaves the "Since Whitsunday 1662" page
blank—Daniel later realizes Isaac has stopped believing himself capable of sin.
In 1713 Boston, Daniel discusses his departure with Faith and Wait Still
Waterhouse (a Free Will preacher), arguing his mind is a deterministic machine.
He believes leaving will create a better fantasy father for Godfrey than his
flawed reality could provide.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 14: Words 26001-28000
-----------------------------
Word count: 159

Daniel debates theology with Wait Still, rejecting Free Will in favor of
mechanistic predestination based on Natural Philosophy rather than Calvinism. He
compares souls to alchemical Quintessence—something Newton has sought without
success. Faith wears a caduceus hairpin and blushes when Daniel suggests Wait
Still will raise Godfrey, implying romantic interest. Daniel argues his
departure will give Godfrey an idealized phantom father rather than a flawed
real one. At the wharf, slaves row him to Minerva through Boston Harbor, passing
pirate corpses in gibbets on tidal islands—a grim honor guard for his departure.
The slaves sing a strange African-Irish lament that reminds each of their own
capture and transport. Daniel weeps as he leaves, while Mrs. Goose memorizes
events for posterity and Enoch remains to shape the story. The ascent up
Minerva's ladder becomes a Puritan allegory—Jacob's ladder from earthly slaves
to heavenly ship. Lascars haul him aboard as Atlantic rollers rock the vessel
like a mother's breathing bosom.

In 1663 Cambridge, Daniel finds Isaac conducting a horrifying
experiment—inserting a blunt darning needle between his eyeball and socket to
distort the eye's shape and study optics. While Daniel holds up measured
reticules, Isaac manipulates the needle and records observations,
revolutionizing understanding of vision and sensory perception. By sunrise,
Newton knows more about the human eye than anyone ever has. The experiment
demonstrates how observations are distorted by the instruments (including eyes)
used to make them, challenging Boyle's color theories. During chapel, Daniel
experiences an epiphany about perception as his exhausted mind processes the
implications. Aboard Minerva in 1713, Captain van Hoek (a stubby red-headed
Dutchman) shows Daniel to his cabin. The ship moves silently compared to the
slaves' boat, harmonizing with natural forces. Daniel reflects on how his failed
moral test at Trinity freed him to pursue Natural Philosophy despite inevitable
damnation, filling his remaining years with something interesting before his
predestined arrival at Hell's gates.

Daniel wakes aboard Minerva to sunlight streaming through the great wheel,
dividing the sun into sectors like a misguided sundial. This recalls Isaac's
Trinity sundial project—plotting daily shadow curves through seasons to
understand planetary motion. When Daniel asks why sundials fascinate him, Isaac
flees to Jesus Green at night, explaining under moonlight that heavenly rays
contain God's cryptographic messages. The gnomon ("We are gnomon") interrupts
light, casting informative shadows. Recording these reveals partial knowledge
from the divine cryptogram. Isaac wants to predict shadow positions on any
surface, even Saturn's moon—a project with implications for souls, free will,
and whether the world improves or decays toward apocalypse. Aboard Minerva,
Daniel sees nature's perfection: straight horizons, orderly solar progression.
The ship embodies Leibniz-curves navigating by Bernoulli-rules across Newton's
calculated sphere. Daniel envisions shipwreck as a five-act opera progressing
from calm sailing through storm, destruction, and feral survival—humanity's
normal state throughout history.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 17: Words 32001-34000
-----------------------------
Word count: 156

Daniel reflects that his generation was born into chaos (Act V) and raised in
Act IV, while Newton dwelt in a personal bubble of Act II, progressing toward
Act I's perfect order. Cambridge authorities believed the opposite—that the
world had declined from Eden through classical Athens to present decay. Newton
and Daniel prepared for geometry exams while Newton secretly advanced Cartesian
analysis beyond his teachers' comprehension. They consulted Isaac Barrow (who'd
fought pirates), and Newton translated Euclid into algebra in microscopic
marginalia. After receiving their scholarships in 1665, they walk to Stourbridge
Fair along the Cam. Newton explains his theory of fluxions using a punt's
movement along the river's S-curve as example—the changing directional flow over
time. He applies the same analysis to river weeds bent by current, arguing that
translating things into analytical language reveals underlying sameness beneath
superficial differences, like alchemists extracting pure spirits from gross
matter. This mathematical approach frees natural philosophers from Aristotelian
constraints about mixing different natures.

Approaching Stourbridge Fair, Europe's largest, Daniel and Isaac encounter boats
loaded with traders, Gypsies, and merchants. The fair sprawls larger than
Cambridge—a chaos of rope-dancers, puppeteers, prostitutes, and merchants from
across Europe. Isaac, adopting Puritan posture, navigates to a Jewish lens-
grinder's display of prisms and optical equipment. A complex haggling ensues
over two prisms, revealing England's monetary chaos: old hammered coins versus
new milled ones, widespread clipping and counterfeiting, and the export of good
silver to the Orient. The lens-grinder, claiming to be from London via Poland
(not Spain), refuses their Elizabethan and Edwardian shillings as debased or
clipped. Daniel and Isaac present increasingly dubious coins with elaborate
provenances—found at Naseby, obtained from drunken dukes—while discussing the
Great Debasement, Gresham's reforms, and monastery wealth. The Jew tests coins
by biting them, declaring most worthless. This seemingly simple transaction
becomes a dissertation on English coinage's degradation, foreshadowing Newton's
later role as Master of the Mint.

The Jewish merchant suddenly gives Isaac the prisms and packs up when a well-
dressed man collapses nearby, screaming in agony. Despite the servant's attempts
to help, the man convulses and lands in the mud. When they tear off his
breeches, black buboes like cannonballs are visible in his groin—he's dead of
plague. As everyone flees, Isaac approaches to observe the expanding buboes,
fascinated by the "generative spirit" that transforms matter—sometimes creating
life (eyes, leaves, salamanders) and sometimes death (plague buboes). He
questions how Descartes's mechanical philosophy of matter jostling like coins
could explain such self-organization. Daniel pulls him away, recognizing this as
the beginning of the plague year 1665—halfway to the prophesied apocalypse of
1666. Aboard Minerva in 1713, Daniel continues his temperature measurements for
the Royal Society while living among the ship's polyglot crew of skilled old
hands who've made the ship their permanent home.

In summer 1665, Daniel is trapped in plague-ravaged London with his father
Drake, eating potatoes and herring for the thirty-fifth consecutive day.
Cambridge is closed, and Daniel had come for a quick raid on the empty house but
found Drake playing Civil War hymns on the virginal. Drake, mutilated by
Archbishop Laud in 1629 for printing anti-Ship Money libels, makes whistling
noises when eating due to his missing nose. Their days pass with corpse-
collectors' bells, the erratic bonging of a pre-Huygens grandfather clock, and
Daniel studying mathematics while Drake reads Revelation. Daniel announces his
intention to visit John Wilkins at Epsom, where Wilkins tutors the Earl of
Epsom's son in natural philosophy during the plague. Drake grudgingly agrees
after Daniel argues about the "generative spirit" that creates newness from
decay—flowers from manure, maggots from meat. Drake counters that England itself
decays: Cromwell's freedoms replaced by a crypto-Papist king. The House's Delft
plates, made by grateful Leyden pilgrims, bear the inscription "YOU AND I ARE
BUT EARTH."

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 21: Words 40001-42000
-----------------------------
Word count: 153

Daniel convinces Drake that studying natural philosophy during plague times is
essential, arguing that astronomers will first spot apocalyptic comets and
physicians will recognize plague signs. Drake gives him a goldsmith's note for
one pound—a new financial instrument where Uncle Thomas Ham will pay the bearer
on demand. This forces Daniel to demonstrate faith by crossing plague-ridden
London. He sets out in coat and boots despite summer heat, carrying books and
letters from Wilkins and Hooke requesting supplies. Walking down Holborn past
earthwork remnants from the Civil War, he observes death-knells from hundreds of
churches, houses marked with pleas for God's mercy, and corpse-wagons heading to
burial pits. Through Newgate, he sees St. Paul's tower seeming to lean more than
usual, its churchyard fortified with fresh graves piled above ground level. The
cathedral, half-eaten by coal smoke, had served as a stable for Roundhead
cavalry during Cromwell's time while Drake preached in the eastern half.

Daniel explores plague-ravaged London, finding St. Paul's south transept
collapsed with stones reportedly taken for John Comstock's Piccadilly house. On
Cheapside, he sees men removing dead children from boarded houses and a queue at
Dr. Nathaniel Hodges's house—one of few physicians remaining. At Wilkins's
ransacked house, he retrieves requested books. Following Wilkins's cryptic
instructions to "follow the drainpipes, find the Amphib'ns," he traces copper
pipes at St. Lawrence Jewry church to a cellar filled with rat corpses and
flies. In a Roman baptismal font repurposed as a frog habitat, he discovers
enormous, healthy frogs feeding on flies—the generative spirit transmuting death
into life. At Gresham College (Royal Society headquarters), he collects Hooke's
requested items from their bizarre collection: viper organs, sympathetic powder,
bladders, deformed specimens, experimental apparatus, and a request for small
animals (supply "considerably diminished"). He gathers mail addressed to
"GRUBENDOL London" (an anagram for Oldenburg, the only member who stayed in
London).

Daniel visits his Uncle Thomas Ham's goldsmith shop on Threadneedle Street,
finding armed guards on the roof and earthworks being dug. In the cellar,
workers expand a vault containing the Ham brothers' gold deposits—plates, coins,
bars, and "pigs" (irregular gold lumps), each meticulously tagged with depositor
and weight. They're digging down to a Roman mosaic floor featuring Mercury,
which will deter thieves. Thomas gives Daniel a silver pound and an ancient
Roman hairpin shaped like a caduceus, joking it might please a future Mrs.
Waterhouse despite Trinity's celibacy rules. Daniel borrows a heavy wheelbarrow
and delivers the GRUBENDOL packet to Oldenburg's Pall Mall house—letters from
Vienna, Florence, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Moscow. He finds Oldenburg peering
through green window glass, having stayed in London after his wife's death,
perhaps hoping plague will reunite them. The journey to Epsom reveals John
Comstock housing Royal Society Fellows in a remote cottage to enhance his
prestige while keeping them away from his household.

At Epsom, Daniel finds Hooke and Wilkins at a cottage surrounded by experimental
debris: model ships in the pond, windmills on the roof, pulleys connected to
distant chariots, and a bone-yard of dissected animals. Young Charles Comstock
and his friend the Duke of Gunfleet assist with experiments. Daniel learns he'll
share quarters with Isaac Newton, whose reputation for strange behavior has
preceded him. Hooke immediately puts Daniel to work testing air pressure
theories, making him breathe through tubes while submerged in frigid water. At
dinner, Wilkins speaks enthusiastically about reconciling religion and natural
philosophy, coining terms like "Philosophical Language" and discussing his
mechanical flying machines. The cottage operates as a makeshift laboratory where
Hooke's mechanical investigations, Wilkins's linguistic theories, and Newton's
mysterious work proceed simultaneously. The aristocratic youths participate
eagerly, though Hooke treats them as convenient labor. Daniel settles into this
strange household, preparing for his reunion with Newton amidst ongoing
experiments in everything from pneumatics to animal dissection.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 25: Words 48001-50000
-----------------------------
Word count: 157

Daniel assists Wilkins with his Philosophical Language project, organizing all
knowledge into forty genera with unique words for each concept. He compiles
lists: diseases, animals, geometric terms, synonyms for "penis" and "beggar."
Wilkins obsesses over proving Noah's Ark could hold all animals, calculating it
required 1,825 sheep to feed carnivores. When Charles II asks how ant eggs can
be larger than ants, Daniel raids an anthill for Hooke to examine. In Hooke's
laboratory, filled with specimens and microscope samples, Daniel views a needle
under magnification—its "sharp" point revealed as a pitted slag-heap. Hooke
explains he no longer examines man-made objects because "the rudeness and
bungling of Art is painful to view," preferring natural forms that become more
intricate when magnified. He shows Daniel microscope drawings, including a flea
so detailed it reflects entire buildings in its eye. Hooke reveals Wilkins's
urine contains beautiful crystals—evidence of kidney stones that will eventually
kill him.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 26: Words 50001-52000
-----------------------------
Word count: 155

Hooke demonstrates sparks are hollow spheres of molten steel, proving heat isn't
an element but "brisk agitation of parts." He theorizes all spheres—bubbles,
sparks, planets—form when one fluid surrounds another, and suggests measuring
light's speed by timing reflections off the moon. When Daniel proposes using
gunpowder for the experiment, Hooke coldly states he's "thinking like a
courtier." News arrives: Fermat died leaving unproved theorems, Spain's new king
Carlos II is sickly, Poland faces rebellion. Daniel compiles punishments for the
Philosophical Language: beheading, quartering, stoning, hanging, burning,
torture methods. Hooke discovers Wilkins's kidney stone crystals while studying
various specimens. Meanwhile, Charles Comstock tests Wilkins's horse-drawn
vehicles using weights and pulleys. The plague worsens—8,000 die weekly in
London. As autumn arrives, Daniel works on nautical terminology while hearing
Hooke's strange experiments below. The cottage continues as a hub of
investigation, with each resident pursuing different aspects of natural
philosophy while the world outside suffers catastrophe.

Hooke conducts acoustic experiments, measuring fly wing frequencies by tuning
strings to match their buzz, then calculating wing beats per second for future
flying machine research. After autumn rains end chariot experiments, the cottage
focus shifts to cellar work: starving a toad to test spontaneous generation,
keeping a carp alive out of water on moistened bread, and feeding a giant maggot
rotten meat while monitoring its weight. Earl Comstock unexpectedly visits,
diplomatically warning about their noisy, smelly experiments disturbing royal
refugees—including two young princesses who are female, royal, and of tender
years. Daniel gradually realizes the estate houses James, Duke of York (future
James II), his wife Anne Hyde (John Comstock's relation), and their daughters
Mary and Anne, future queens of England. The experimental cottage must
dramatically modify its activities to avoid offending these prominent guests who
fled London's plague. Wilkins abjectly apologizes while Hooke builds toys for
the royal children. The presence of the Lord High Admiral and his family
transforms the isolated research facility into a place requiring royal protocol
and discretion.

SUMMARY 28: Words 54001-56000
-----------------------------
Word count: 153

Daniel realizes John Comstock hosts the Duke of York during wartime Admiralty
meetings, making him dangerous by association as Drake's son. Wilkins explains
Anne Hyde's controversial marriage to James—despite courtiers swearing to her
promiscuity, the Duke married her anyway, creating potential heirs to the
throne. Restricted by royal presence, the experimenters focus on quieter
research: Hooke's air compression studies revealing that air contains life-
sustaining spirit, vacuum pendulum experiments, and Mars rotation observations
through improved telescopes. They test breathing recycled air until exhaustion
and grind lenses while tracking lunar surface features. Hooke theorizes the moon
must have gravity since its mountains maintain stable angles of repose. A
mysterious five-foot spiral horn arrives from Amsterdam, which Wilkins
identifies as a "unicorn horn" available for purchase in Dutch markets. The
completed Philosophical Language tables create a numerical system for
categorizing all knowledge, while Wilkins develops pronunciation-based character
shapes by manipulating a severed head's vocal apparatus to create systematic
alphabet symbols reflecting actual mouth positions during speech.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 29: Words 56001-58000
-----------------------------
Word count: 151

Wilkins and Hooke conduct gruesome experiments using a severed criminal's head
to create the "Real Character"—an alphabet where letter shapes reflect the
physical mouth positions needed to produce each sound. By manipulating the
corpse's vocal apparatus with bellows, they generate thirty-four distinct sounds
and design corresponding phonetic symbols. Hooke tests gravitational theory by
weighing objects at different depths in a 300-foot well, finding no measurable
change in weight—though he notes more precise instruments could detect
variations through pendulum clock timing. Winter brings thermometer calibration
using freezing water marks and microscopic snowflake observations, where Hooke
puzzles over why each flake's six arms develop identically despite unique
overall patterns. During a live dog vivisection exposing the beating heart, the
Duke of York unexpectedly visits and privately confides to Daniel about needing
a cure for syphilis—affecting "a friend" but clearly meaning himself and
potentially his wife and daughters, making this a dynastic crisis since James is
heir to the throne. The Duke strategically chose Daniel because Drake's son's
accusations would be dismissed as typical Puritan ranting.

The Duke of York observes Hooke's artificial respiration experiment, where a dog
survives with opened chest cavity through bellows-operated lung inflation,
demonstrating the Royal Society's life-sustaining techniques. James, battle-
hardened from naval and land combat, shows no revulsion at the surgical
procedure, viewing it as mild compared to wartime carnage he's witnessed. His
request for syphilis treatment reveals the Stuart dynasty's medical crisis—if
the disease affects his wife and daughters (future queens Mary and Anne), it
threatens royal succession since King Charles II has no legitimate heirs. Daniel
realizes the Duke strategically chose him because any rumors from Drake's son
would be dismissed as religious fanaticism, while the threat of deadly dueling
ensures silence. As dawn breaks over the blood-soaked kitchen strewn with
experimental remains, the natural philosophers experience revulsion at their
yearlong orgy of investigation. Daniel, walking into the pre-dawn field toward
blazing Venus, receives Isaac's letter requesting astronomical assistance. Four
hours later, he rides north toward Newton, leaving behind the house of carnage
for celestial observations, symbolically moving from earthly butchery to
heavenly harmony.

Aboard Minerva in November 1713, Daniel awakens worried in Plymouth Bay,
Massachusetts, after Captain van Hoek retreated from a fierce Atlantic gale. The
ship anchors in a sheltered inlet for repairs and to await favorable westward
winds, but van Hoek remains nervous, doubling the watch and cleaning firearms.
Daniel has spent weeks learning to read the Dutch captain's moods through his
footstep patterns on the poop deck—today van Hoek moves with unusual agitation,
flitting between rails while sailors work quietly below. A distant boom rattles
Daniel's cabin windows, followed by answering fire from surrounding hills and
islands, suggesting the ship has encountered some form of colonial coastal
defense or territorial challenge. The narrative shifts from the plague-era
Cambridge memories to present dangers in American waters, where Minerva faces
new perils after surviving the ocean crossing. The ship's comprehensive arsenal
and doubled security measures indicate serious concern about their current
location in Massachusetts colonial waters.

Minerva faces attack from whaleboats containing pirates armed with grappling
hooks and muskets, prompting brutal defensive measures including dropping
flaming comets and grenade attacks. Dappa explains van Hoek's absolute refusal
to compromise with pirates, preferring to burn his ship rather than surrender.
Their crew includes retired grenadiers and Filipino pearl divers who specialize
in cutting throats underwater. Five surviving pirates are interrogated through
waterboarding in the bilge while their damaged whaleboat serves as grim
evidence. Daniel flashes back to spring 1666 at Woolsthorpe Manor, Isaac
Newton's surprisingly pleasant ancestral home amid rolling Lincolnshire
countryside. Newton, wearing gold spectacles to protect his sun-damaged eyes,
has been conducting optical experiments using Venus as a point light source to
refute critics of his prism work. The house displays the Newton family coat of
arms—crossed human thigh-bones on a blank shield—suggesting deeper family
dysfunction. Newton greets Daniel tenderly, explaining his need for assistance
since his burned retinas cannot detect the faint Venus spectrum, requiring
Daniel's healthy vision for the crucial observations that will validate his
revolutionary theories about light and color.

At Woolsthorpe in 1666, Newton theorizes planetary motion through his gravity
insights, explaining how sufficient horizontal velocity could make objects orbit
Earth like planets—inspired by his childhood experience being carried by
"Satan's Wind" during Cromwell's funeral. Using his "method of fluxions"
(calculus), Newton demonstrates that orbital mechanics naturally produce
elliptical paths without divine intervention. Daniel and Isaac conduct nocturnal
Venus spectrum experiments in Newton's childhood bedroom, surrounded by his
inventions and wall sketches from lonely years before Cambridge. As the plague
year progresses, Daniel splits time between Newton's optical research, Wilkins's
Universal Character manuscript, and Drake's apocalyptic calculations. When the
Great Fire of London begins in September 1666, Daniel rides toward the burning
city through falling ash—charred Bible pages and account books raining from the
sky. Reaching Holborn, he finds Drake on his roof holding a Bible while King
Charles II personally orders the destruction of Drake's house to create
firebreaks. As the fuse burns toward hidden powder kegs, a royal guardsman
shoots Daniel with a blunderbuss, and he watches his father explode upward into
the flames—a horrific apotheosis ending their complex, unresolved relationship
in fire and theological symbolism.

Daniel's anguished response to Drake's death reveals his emotional reversion to
childhood—calling out "Father?" to the glowing cloud that consumed his parent
during the Great Fire of London. The explosion and blunderbuss wounds strip away
his Natural Philosophy rationalism, leaving only the sentimental logic of a
bewildered five-year-old desperate to prevent his father's departure. Daniel
recognizes this theological imagery as a terrible inversion—instead of God
revealing Himself through fiery theophany, the flames have hidden Drake forever
within the "Mysterium Tremendum." His silent weeping aboard Minerva in 1713
demonstrates mature suffering without delusions of rescue, contrasting with
childish crying that expects comfort. The ship suddenly mobilizes as enemy boats
converge from Plymouth Bay's coves and inlets. Van Hoek and Dappa orchestrate an
elaborate deception, disguising Daniel as an incompetent elderly captain while
making the ship appear vulnerable and panicked. This theatrical performance
involves cutting anchor cables, reversing telescopes, and staging apparent
helplessness to manipulate multiple competing pirate factions. The strategy
suggests complex local pirate politics, with traditional Plymouth Bay pirates
now threatened by newer, more aggressive groups disrupting established
territorial arrangements.

Daniel plays his role as a doddering ship captain while Dappa explains their
elaborate deception strategy designed to manipulate competing pirate factions in
Plymouth Bay. Van Hoek disguises himself as an ordinary seaman while Daniel
feigns panic and incompetence, complete with mishandling a telescope and
displaying apparent terror at incoming cannon fire. The performance includes
staged explosions and theatrical panic as multiple pirate boats converge, some
firing real cannonballs while others use wooden mock cannons. Dappa reveals the
bay contains an unusual concentration of pirates, including traditional local
ones threatened by a newer, more aggressive breed. The deception strategy
involves multiple layers of bluffing to handle different pirate groups
simultaneously. A pirate attempts to board through the stern windows but is shot
by Dappa, who then retrieves van Hoek's prosthetic hook from a chest. The
incident demonstrates the real dangers underlying their theatrical performance,
as the newer pirate faction has apparently disrupted the established order and
driven desperate traditional pirates to increasingly reckless attacks on well-
defended merchant vessels.

Dappa identifies Captain Edward Teach (Blackbeard) as leader of the approaching
pirate fleet, a former Royal Navy officer who served in the recent war against
Spain but now turns to American piracy after the peace treaty. Teach wants
Minerva as his flagship rather than just cargo, making him a persistent threat
regardless of concessions. The narrative shifts to London's Royal Exchange in
September 1686, where Daniel sits amid a theatrical performance orchestrated
around Newton's Principia Mathematica and Leibniz's response. Roger Comstock,
Marquis of Ravenscar, brings Leibniz's latest mathematical work featuring the
Integral Calculus, while Daniel delivers Newton's revolutionary manuscript
explaining the System of the World. Their exchange becomes a public drama about
competing mathematical philosophies, with Daniel playing the role of Pluto, god
of secrets and the underworld. Sir Richard Apthorp, a banker, observes their
cryptic dialogue while conducting his own commodity trading based on
intelligence about military preparations. The scene establishes the complex
intellectual and political tensions surrounding the Newton-Leibniz mathematical
rivalry in Restoration England.

A dramatic book-burning ceremony interrupts the Royal Exchange as Jack Ketch
publicly destroys "A History of the Late Massacres and Persecutions of the
French Huguenots" on King James II's orders. The theatrical execution
demonstrates royal power while intimidating Protestant merchants and
intellectuals who might support rebellion. Daniel reveals he orchestrated this
public display to maintain his position as the King's "token Puritan bootlick"
while actually stirring rebellious sentiment among the wealthy and powerful.
Edmund Palling, bound for Massachusetts, observes that burning books cannot
destroy their ideas, which spread like smoke on the wind. Sir Richard Apthorp
discovers through commodity trading that the King is purchasing military
supplies for domestic use rather than foreign wars, suggesting preparation to
fight Englishmen rather than foreign enemies. The scene concludes with Daniel's
cryptic verse about hoping foreign invasion will give English soldiers
legitimate enemies to fight instead of their own countrymen. This complex
political theater reveals the delicate balance between loyalty and treason in
James II's increasingly Catholic and authoritarian regime, while Newton's
Principia heads to the printer as a monument to English intellectual
achievement.

Ravenscar dismisses Daniel's elaborate political theater as "modestly
sophisticated" and focuses on the Newton-Leibniz philosophical dispute. Daniel
explains that Descartes' vortex theory fails when tested against reality, while
Newton's inverse square law accurately describes planetary motion without
explaining its cause. Newton attributes gravity to God's presence, while Leibniz
seeks mechanical explanations through fundamental particles called monads.
Ravenscar mentions Leibniz's turn to genealogical research, which Daniel
suggests masks deeper political plotting related to royal succession and
syphilis affecting the Stuart dynasty. At Versailles in 1687, Eliza de la Zeur
reports managing investments for French nobles while maintaining her cover as a
tutor. She manipulates court conversations about market speculation,
particularly proposing to crash Amsterdam's V.O.C. stock through spreading false
news of Batavia's fall. At a masquerade ball at Dampierre, she successfully
convinces King Louis XIV and his naval commanders to implement this financial
warfare scheme against Dutch markets, demonstrating how economic manipulation
can achieve military objectives without direct confrontation.

Eliza continues her letter to d'Avaux, describing the elaborate garden party at
Versailles featuring a theatrical re-enactment of the fictional "Fall of
Batavia" that she had proposed to crash Amsterdam's stock market. The
performance included dream-ships representing French virtues attacking a model
Dutch settlement while the inhabitants slept counting gold, only to awaken and
find their wealth vanished through stage magic. Each vessel was captained by a
Duke or noble representing virtues like Fertility, Martial Prowess, and Piety—a
celebration of French superiority over materialistic Dutch merchants. This
entertainment masked the serious financial warfare being conducted against the
Dutch East India Company through coordinated market manipulation. Meanwhile, the
narrative reveals how France's peace has brought prosperity and construction at
Versailles, with many courtiers profiting from the Amsterdam market crash. The
theatrical performance serves both as entertainment and propaganda, reinforcing
French cultural values while celebrating their economic victory over Protestant
commercial rivals through sophisticated financial manipulation rather than
military conquest.

Eliza encounters Earl Upnor at Versailles, who openly discusses his English
Protestant slave-girl, comparing Irish and English enslavement to French galley
sentences for Huguenots. She realizes this refers to Abigail Frome from Bob
Shaftoe's stories, finding Upnor's casual acceptance of enslaving English girls
repugnant to most people outside Versailles. She predicts this will fuel English
rebellion against James II, noting the King's military preparations around
London. Eliza questions Leibniz about genealogical research and occult matters,
particularly regarding Enoch Root and Trinity College connections. She observes
mysterious behaviors around alchemical topics and mentions suspicious poisoning
deaths at court, including the Duke of Gunfleet and others at garden parties.
Meanwhile, Daniel Waterhouse travels to meet William Penn in Holland,
intercepting him before his audience with William of Orange. Penn, owner of
Pennsylvania, complains about his territorial disputes while Daniel carries
letters from powerful English supporters planning rebellion. The scene
establishes the complex web of Protestant resistance building against Catholic
King James II, with American colonial interests intersecting European political
machinations and religious conflicts.

At William of Orange's hunting lodge near The Hague, Daniel meets with a
mysterious French girl who serves as translator and proves surprisingly
perceptive about political matters. She correctly analyzes both Daniel and Penn
as belonging to the same Puritan sect despite their differences, noting their
shared integrity and resistance to corruption. William interrogates her about
her fascination with Puritans, suspecting hidden motives until she explains
their formidable nature and anti-slavery convictions, particularly Gomer
Bolstrood's prediction that Quakers would lead a universal abolition movement.
William finds her oddities trustworthy, preferring people with peculiar ideas to
conventional thinkers. She identifies Daniel as the more dangerous of the two
Englishmen despite his lack of territory or wealth, recognizing him as a
desperate man gambling his life on rebellion after being checked and baffled
throughout his career. William acknowledges the accuracy of her psychological
insight while fearing such penetrating analysis applied to himself. Their
conversation reveals the careful intelligence-gathering operation surrounding
the planned English rebellion, with William needing both men alive but requiring
Daniel to develop stronger survival instincts through emotional attachment—a
task he assigns to Eliza.

At Huygens's house, Eliza orchestrates a dinner party bringing together Daniel
Waterhouse, Nicolas Fatio de Duilliers, and Christiaan Huygens to facilitate
introductions between the Royal Society and ambitious young mathematicians.
Fatio, a brilliant but desperate Swiss scholar, dominates conversation while
probing for alchemical connections through mentions of Enoch Root, which
Waterhouse refuses to acknowledge. The discussion shifts to Newton's
revolutionary work that has stunned Natural Philosophers across Europe, with
Fatio proposing his own gravitational theory using æther disturbances to explain
planetary motion. Eliza finds herself attracted to Waterhouse's vulnerability
while observing Fatio's relentless energy and genuine mathematical talent
despite his social desperation. The evening moves to Huygens's rooftop
observatory where they examine Saturn through telescopes while Fatio reveals
dangerous intelligence about Count Fenil's plot to kidnap William of Orange
during his regular sand-sailing expeditions on Dutch beaches. This French-
sponsored scheme would dramatically alter European politics by capturing the
Protestant Defender, demonstrating how mathematical gatherings mask serious
intelligence operations in the interconnected world of 17th-century European
politics.

Fatio reveals Count Fenil's detailed assassination plot against William of
Orange, involving French dragoons landing by single ship to ambush the Prince
during his predictable morning sand-sailing routine between Scheveningen and
Katwijk. Fenil, a Savoyard noble who became "more French than the French" after
serving under Louvois, seeks to prove his loyalty following recent French
military demonstrations. Eliza realizes this intelligence comes from her
position between d'Avaux's diplomatic circle and William's court, creating
dangerous tensions in her double-agent status. At the Binnenhof's evening
soirée, which she declined to attend with d'Avaux in favor of hosting the
dinner, political undercurrents swirl around William Penn's presence and various
diplomatic representatives. The evening establishes complex layers of espionage
and betrayal, with Eliza navigating between French and Dutch intelligence while
Fatio demonstrates his value as both mathematician and spy. The scene reveals
how intellectual gatherings serve as covers for international intrigue, with
astronomical observations providing opportunities for sharing crucial
intelligence about threats to Protestant leadership across Europe.

D'Avaux grows suspicious of Eliza's relationship changes since her Versailles
assignment, questioning her loyalty as their dynamic shifts from recruiter-asset
to something more complex and potentially threatening. Eliza recognizes the
dangerous territory of double-agent work, where competing allegiances create
impossible situations requiring constant deception and calculation. The tension
between her French diplomatic connections and growing Dutch Protestant
sympathies reflects the broader European religious and political conflicts of
the era. As various intelligence networks intersect around William of Orange's
court, Eliza must navigate increasingly sophisticated espionage operations while
maintaining her cover as a mathematical enthusiast and social climber. The
soirée at the Binnenhof represents the visible diplomatic world, while the real
power struggles occur in private meetings like Huygens's dinner party, where
scientific discourse masks crucial intelligence exchanges about assassination
plots and military preparations. Fatio's revelations about French schemes
demonstrate how individual scientists and mathematicians become unwitting or
willing participants in international conspiracies, with their mobility and
international connections making them valuable intelligence assets for competing
European powers seeking advantage in the coming conflicts.

Eliza awakens at nine o'clock to perfect sand-sailing weather and realizes the
French assassination plot is unfolding. Borrowing Jack Shaftoe's horse-thievery
techniques, she rides bareback on Vla, her favorite mare, galloping desperately
toward Scheveningen while shouting royal proclamations to clear the way. Fatio
pursues on horseback as they race against time to warn William of Orange. They
discover the Duc d'Arcachon's ship Météore offshore and reach the Prince's boat-
house just after William has departed for his regular sand-sailing expedition.
Despite chaos involving Blue Guards, marines, and local watch forces, Eliza
commandeers another sand-sailer with Fatio as pilot. Using her experience as
counterweight, they achieve extraordinary speeds pursuing the Prince up the
beach while Guards fire cannon signals that William interprets as routine ship
salutes. The thrilling chase combines Stephenson's fascination with physics,
period technology, and adventure as mathematical principles of sailing enable
their desperate rescue mission. Their improvised partnership demonstrates both
Eliza's resourcefulness and the era's intersection of scientific knowledge with
practical survival skills.

Eliza and Fatio's sand-sailer crashes into the French dragoons ambushing William
of Orange, but successfully disrupts Count Fenil's kidnapping plot. William
fights valiantly with his sword while Fatio is captured, and Eliza seizes the
French longboat by threatening a lone guard with a possibly-damaged pistol.
Using Newton's laws of motion, she systematically rows the escape vessel away
from shore despite waves and a swimming pursuer, whom she repel by launching a
gun-chest at his face. When French musket fire splinters the boat's benches,
Blue Guards arrive to rescue the Prince and capture the surviving dragoons.
William recognizes that d'Avaux was hiding nearby to witness his humiliation,
making this assassination attempt "the spark that ignites the pan" forcing
William to invade Britain. He assigns Eliza a crucial mission: seduce Liselotte
(Madame), Louis XIV's sister-in-law and claimant to the Palatinate succession,
to learn French military intentions regarding the Rhine campaigns. William
explains that Louis's chivalrous support for Liselotte's inheritance claims
masks territorial expansion, while British conquest would compensate for French
gains. Eliza accepts this dangerous intelligence assignment despite her
precarious position with d'Avaux, who may have witnessed her treachery.

By early 1688, Eliza reports from Versailles that Louis XIV has mysteriously
ennobled her as Countess de la Zeur, supposedly based on her hereditary
connection to the Qwghlmian towers. Father Édouard de Gex probes her about
Qwghlmian Church doctrine, suggesting potential religious reconciliation while
French nobles express sympathy for her island's "barbaric occupation" by
England. She recognizes Louis's strategy of cultivating relationships with
Ireland, Scotland, and Qwghlm as potential allies against a hostile Protestant
ruler in England. Her new title grants access to court society and enables
closer relationships with foreign princesses, while Madame (Liselotte) now
treats her as social equal rather than dismissing her as "mouse turd in the
pepper." Meanwhile, Daniel awakens drugged in Westminster's Star Chamber, where
Lord Chancellor Jeffreys tortures him with an iron slave collar featuring
projecting hooks designed to prevent escape through vegetation. Jeffreys charges
Daniel with "perverting the English language" by using "revolution" in a
political rather than astronomical sense, conducting a sham trial that recalls
his father Drake's earlier persecution by Archbishop Laud in the same chamber.

Jeffreys continues torturing Daniel with the slave collar, using it to
demonstrate his twisted philosophy of revolution where "raising the low makes
the high low" through inevitable violence. He reveals that Newton visited London
and met with Fatio rather than Daniel, calling the Swiss mathematician a traitor
for warning William of Orange about French plots. The mock Star Chamber trial
serves both as personal revenge and psychological warfare, with Jeffreys
systematically destroying Daniel's confidence through physical torture and
verbal humiliation. Rather than impose a legal sentence, Jeffreys condemns
Daniel to live with knowledge of his own cowardice, comparing him unfavorably to
his martyred father Drake. The torture session ends with bailiffs dumping Daniel
in the fields between Westminster and Chelsea, still wearing the collar. He
manages to remove the wooden peg securing the collar and uses it as a weapon
while wandering through the dangerous Hogs-den area. The encounter demonstrates
James II's increasingly authoritarian methods and the personal vendettas driving
political persecution during this period of religious and constitutional crisis.

Daniel stumbles through Pimlico's wasteland of feral animals and criminal
enterprises before reaching Sterling Waterhouse's construction site, where he's
recognized by a porter and given ale and transport back to Gresham's College. An
encrypted letter from Eliza awaits him, which he decodes using binary notation
and I Ching hexagram 19 as the key, revealing her message "I AM COMING." At the
College, he encounters Nicolas Fatio de Duilliers, who has taken refuge in
London after warning William of Orange about the assassination plot. Fatio
notices Daniel's neck wounds but politely doesn't inquire about their origin.
Daniel's thoughts obsess over Eliza, who represents fifty percent of his mental
energy despite the repetitive nature of his thinking. He decrypts the full
message revealing Eliza's travel plans and intentions to visit Whitehall Palace
during her London stay. His inability to urinate properly suggests physical
trauma from the torture, while his fixation on Eliza begins revealing itself as
potentially manipulative rather than romantic, particularly regarding her timing
coinciding with Queen Mary's expected delivery.

Daniel completes deciphering Eliza's message and realizes her London visit
coincides perfectly with Queen Mary's pregnancy, suggesting she's using their
relationship to gain Whitehall access for intelligence gathering about potential
royal succession. His physical deterioration from Jeffreys's torture becomes
evident through difficulty urinating and the rust-colored urine indicating
kidney damage or bladder stones. The timing analysis reveals that Eliza will
arrive during the controversial period following James II's Declaration of
Indulgence, when Daniel's reputation will be under attack from High Church
opponents. The Queen's sudden pregnancy, which seemed to develop unusually
quickly, raises suspicions about its legitimacy—crucial intelligence for
European markets and political stability. At Versailles, Eliza writes to d'Avaux
using a new cipher, reporting successful investments through commodity trading
and market manipulation, particularly in silver markets affected by England's
debased coinage and counterfeiting problems. She reveals her two visits to
London, including access to Whitehall during the Queen's labor through her
seduction of Daniel, whom she describes as connected to the Royal Society and
banking networks. Her reports demonstrate sophisticated understanding of
London's emerging financial systems, including the development of specialized
coffee houses and Lloyd's insurance market.

Eliza writes to d'Avaux from Versailles, discussing her newfound acceptance by
Madame (Liselotte), who previously scorned her but now recognizes her due to her
financial independence through investments. Eliza analyzes Madame's psychology:
her hatred of ambitious young women like de Maintenon and her preference for
those with external assets. At Versailles, young noblewomen have limited time to
secure their futures through marriage or face convent life—making them
desperately cruel. Eliza's investment activities distinguish her from these
"plucked roses," earning Madame's respect. They discuss hunting, with Eliza
humorously describing Qwghlm's poverty and lack of proper saddles. Meanwhile,
Daniel remains imprisoned in the Tower of London in summer 1688, in the same
chamber where Oldenburg was held twenty years earlier. His world consists of
stone walls covered with ancient graffiti from condemned prisoners. He expects
imminent murder by Jeffreys but finds only silence and time for spiritual
reflection, discovering his soul as empty as a "sacked cathedral"—no wife,
children, or lasting accomplishments beyond being "son of Drake."

After twenty days imprisonment, Daniel observes major changes at the Tower—new
guards from the King's Own Black Torrent Guards replace the previous regiment,
suggesting political upheaval. His conditions improve with better food and
oysters from Roger Comstock, challenging his theory about disembodied
consciousness as the oysters' sensual pleasure affects him profoundly. He
recalls his former mistress Tess's horrific smallpox death as a warning against
fleshly pleasures. Robert Hooke visits, bringing ale and observing Daniel's
attempts to reconstruct Newton's proofs on the wall. Their conversation reveals
deep professional jealousy, with Hooke confessing envy of Newton's Principia.
Daniel eloquently defends Hooke's unique perceptual genius compared to Newton's
mathematical brilliance, arguing that Hooke sees what millions have looked at
but never perceived. A master sergeant arrives, younger than expected but
battle-scarred, who reveals the kingdom's crisis: widespread disbelief that
James II's son is legitimate, rumors of a changeling smuggled in a warming-pan,
and the King's resulting political retreat from both Catholic and Anglican
positions.

The sergeant reveals Daniel's precarious position as Churchill commands the
Guards but the King no longer trusts him, hence their relocation to the Tower. A
letter arrives for "Grubendol" from Leibniz, which the sergeant recognizes as
Daniel's correspondence. The sergeant confronts Daniel about conveying letters
to William of Orange and mentions written orders from Jeffreys allowing only
"Bob Carver and Dick Gripp" to visit—obvious aliases for assassins. Daniel begs
the sergeant to rebel against these murderous orders. Leibniz's letter discusses
his upcoming journey to Italy for genealogical research supporting Sophie's
claims, and his failed silver-mining venture in the Harz mountains. He then
launches into profound philosophical discourse about geometrical versus non-
geometrical truths, critiquing both Descartes' flawed collision theory and
Newton's limitation to geometrical explanations. Leibniz introduces his concept
of mv² (vis viva) as a conserved quantity transcending geometry into algebra,
representing work and energy. He argues this demonstrates truths beyond Newton's
geometrical dome—truths involving fitness and final causes that Newton dismisses
as merely "how God made it," relegating them to alchemy rather than natural
philosophy.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 54: Words 106001-108000

Leibniz continues his philosophical argument, asserting that mv² represents non-
geometrical truths about the universe that Newton wrongly attributes to God's
arbitrary choice. Unlike alchemists who see mystical forces everywhere, Leibniz
recognizes only bodies and minds, believing God must reveal nature through
mechanical laws we can understand. He asks Daniel to defend him to the Royal
Society, clarifying he seeks to extend, not destroy, Newton's work. Sergeant Bob
Shaftoe arrives announcing "Bob Carver and Dick Gripp," but reveals he's not
admitting the assassins—he had Dick Gripp whipped and recruited both into the
King's guards. Bob Carver confessed Jeffreys ordered them to slowly cut Daniel's
throat. Shaftoe proposes a pact: they'll kill both Jeffreys and Upnor (who owns
Shaftoe's love Abigail, one of the Taunton schoolgirls sold during the Bloody
Assizes). Daniel, who has kidney stones and expects to die within a year,
agrees. Shaftoe explains that Jeffreys's attempt to murder Daniel signals he's
abandoning the dynasty and preparing to flee—making him vulnerable to England's
coming revolution.

Daniel agrees to join Shaftoe's plot against Jeffreys, explaining that
revolution differs from rebellion—it's inexorable like stellar motion, driven by
unseen powers. He realizes Jeffreys's decision to kill him indicates the Lord
Chancellor is abandoning James II's cause. Daniel abandons his unfinished
geometric proof on the wall, declaring it obsolete. The narrative shifts to
November 1688 at Château Juvisy, where royal cryptanalyst Bonaventure Rossignol
writes to Louis XIV about intercepting correspondence from the Countess de la
Zeur (Eliza). Rossignol inherited his position from his father, who helped
suppress Huguenot rebellions through code-breaking. He's particularly interested
in Eliza's voluminous letters to Leibniz, suspecting they contain encrypted
messages despite appearing to be mere descriptions of Versailles fashion.
D'Avaux had informed him that Eliza is an agent of William of Orange, connected
to Fatio de Duilliers. Rather than arrest her immediately, they hope to break
her cipher. Eliza's August letter from St. Cloud uses transparent metaphors—the
King's hunting dogs Phobos and Deimos represent French military might
threatening either the Dutch Republic or Palatinate.

Eliza's letter continues describing St. Cloud's decadent atmosphere, where
Monsieur (the King's brother) entertains male lovers while Madame (Liselotte)
remains isolated with her lap-dogs. The household politics mirror court
intrigues, with Monsieur's favorites undermining Madame's attendants. Liselotte
refuses fashion games, having costumes sewn as single constructs she can step
into quickly. Eliza uses elaborate metaphors: the King's hunting dogs Phobos and
Deimos represent French armies that have "killed chickens" (conquered Savoy) and
now seek new targets—either north (Dutch Republic) or east (Palatinate). The
letter mentions a promised bareback riding demonstration. Rossignol reports that
Eliza did go riding with Madame, supposedly fell off, and was taken to a convent
for recovery—obviously a cover story for pregnancy. However, d'Avaux later
spotted her arriving in The Hague on a canal boat from Nijmegen, among
Palatinate refugees including Princess Eleanor of Saxe-Eisenach and Wilhelmina
Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach. This proves Eliza has "run her true colors up
the mast" as William of Orange's agent, abandoning her French cover.

D'Avaux reports to Rossignol that Eliza has taken residence in William of
Orange's Binnenhof palace, openly revealing her allegiance. She arrived with
minimal possessions: ruined clothes, an embroidery frame with water-damaged
crewel-work, and basic personal items. Despite having nothing else, she guards
the embroidery jealously, even sleeping with it. After meeting with William for
three days, he withdrew troops and launched his invasion of England. Rossignol
travels to The Hague in October 1688, arriving as William's fleet departs.
Through investigation and Occam's Razor, he deduces Eliza encoded intelligence
in her embroidery using cross-stitch orientation (northwest-southeast vs.
southwest-northeast) to represent binary digits. With help from Qwghlmian
sailors, he realizes she used their incredibly concise runic language—16
consonants perfectly suited to 4-bit binary encoding. After translation by a
Jesuit priest fluent in Qwghlmian, Rossignol obtains 40,000 Latin words from
Eliza's 30,000 runes. The decoded journal reveals how she traveled from St.
Cloud to Nijmegen, beginning with her August rendezvous with Madame for the
supposed bareback riding demonstration.

Rossignol explains his cryptanalysis of Eliza's embroidery, discovering she used
binary encoding where cross-stitch orientation represents 1s and 0s. Each
Qwghlmian rune requires four binary digits, creating an efficient cipher from an
already cryptic language. Eliza's decoded journal begins August 17, 1688,
revealing she escaped St. Cloud hidden in a boat, then traveled up the Seine and
Marne rivers disguised as a boy. Aboard the chaland of M. LeBrun, she observes
river traffic while pretending to be his simple-minded son. She develops a
method to detect heavily-laden vessels by timing their rocking motion with
Huygens's watch—ships carrying dense cargo like lead in their bilges rock more
slowly than those with distributed loads. This allows her to identify suspicious
chalands heading upriver despite their innocent-looking cargo of barrels. At
St.-Dizier she changes to women's clothes and lodges at a dissolute convent,
posing as Liselotte's relative traveling to collect inheritance from the
Palatinate. She awaits an escort that never arrives, using the time to
investigate mysterious nighttime cargo operations at the docks.

At St.-Dizier's convent, Eliza observes suspicious cargo operations at night.
Disguised in boy's clothes, she witnesses heavy objects being unloaded from
chalands under supervision of a fashionably-dressed courtier. When discovered,
she escapes with local Vagabonds and hires one to track the ox-carts carrying
the cargo. She identifies the courtier as the Chevalier d'Adour through a seal
on a letter to his cousin Eloise, learning he serves Maréchal Louvois. Her hired
spy reports the heavy cargo travels east through Lorraine to Alsace, converging
on the fortress of Haguenau where trees are being felled for firewood and
lumber. Eliza deduces the lead is being melted into ammunition while lumber
builds barges to transport it down tributaries to the Rhine. She realizes the
Chevalier de Lorraine, Monsieur's chief lover, facilitates military movements
through his territory—showing how France exploits even intimate court
relationships for strategic advantage. The preparations clearly indicate an
imminent invasion of the Palatinate, explaining why her promised escort from
Heidelberg never arrived.

Eliza's journal reveals how court relationships serve France's military
strategy: the Chevalier de Lorraine, though technically a vassal of the Holy
Roman Emperor, is completely surrounded by French territory and serves French
interests while maintaining his position as Monsieur's lover. She recognizes
that lead shipments to Haguenau indicate imminent invasion of the Palatinate via
Rhine barges. The narrative structure shows Rossignol presenting Eliza's decoded
journal to Louis XIV as translated from Qwghlmian runes embedded in her
embroidery—a remarkably sophisticated intelligence operation. The journal
entries demonstrate Eliza's analytical skills: using physics to detect weapons
shipments, employing street criminals for surveillance, and interpreting court
politics' strategic implications. Her cover story about collecting Liselotte's
inheritance provides perfect justification for traveling toward the Palatinate,
though the invasion preparations explain why her escort never materialized. The
document illustrates the era's intersection of personal relationships, court
intrigue, and military intelligence, with Eliza successfully gathering crucial
information about French invasion plans while maintaining her cover identity
until reaching Dutch territory.

The Countess reflects on King Louis XIV's strategic thinking through metaphor,
particularly regarding the planned invasion of the Palatinate. She realizes
Louis sees his brother's domestic troubles at St. Cloud as a metaphor for
territorial expansion. Dr. Ernst von Pfung, a Heidelberg scholar haunted by
Catholic invasions of his homeland, arrives to escort her. They travel eastward,
encountering French military preparations. The Countess, disguised as a nun,
later changes to an elegant dress to extract intelligence from a French officer.
She learns that French forces are gathering lead supplies and that Marshal de
Louvois may be heading toward the Meuse. The narrative reveals the methodical
French military buildup, with ox-carts carrying lead ingots through the Argonne
Forest, while the Countess and von Pfung witness the inexorable preparations for
war that will devastate the German Protestant territories.

The Countess continues her intelligence-gathering mission by flirting with a
French cavalry officer, pretending to seek her uncle among the military
commanders. Through careful manipulation, she learns that Marshal de Louvois is
expected along the Meuse River, heading toward the Saarland. Their party reaches
the Meuse valley, where they witness massive French military preparations:
thousands of trees felled, smoke filling the valley, and landing stages
constructed for receiving regiments from the Dutch front. Dr. von Pfung suffers
a stroke upon seeing evidence of the impending invasion of his homeland. The
Countess's group stumbles into a French cavalry camp, where she boldly
identifies herself as Countess de la Zeur, claiming to represent the Duchess of
Orleans. This audacious lie gains her access to Étienne d'Arcachon, who has an
artificial hand collection. She spends the night with him, using a mechanized
jade phallus, gathering intelligence while her dying companion awaits his fate.

After her encounter with Étienne d'Arcachon, the Countess finds a love poem he
left behind. She arranges for Dr. von Pfung to receive medical care while
planning their escape. Their group pretends to head west but actually splits up
- von Pfung's carriage attempting to reach Heidelberg while the Countess heads
north with two Palatinate cavalrymen. French soldiers spot von Pfung's coat of
arms and open fire, destroying the carriage and killing both the driver and
doctor. The Countess and her escorts flee through the Ardennes Forest, dodging
French military traffic and deserters. Her journal entries become fragmented as
they navigate dangerous territory. They eventually reach Dutch-controlled areas
near Nijmegen, where the German cavalrymen seek news from the Rhine. The
Countess boards a canal boat bound for The Hague, documenting French regiment
movements while reflecting on the revolution that has been accomplished through
slow evolution rather than dramatic apocalypse.

The Countess travels by canal boat toward The Hague, where she encounters
Princess Eleanor of Saxe-Eisenach and her five-year-old daughter Caroline.
Eleanor, a widow cast out from Brandenburg-Ansbach, has been wandering Europe as
a "Vagabond Princess" with her daughter. They had fled Mannheim during French
bombardment and are now refugees seeking safety in the Dutch Republic. The
Countess reflects on the "Märchenwelt" (fairy-tale world) intersecting with
reality during wartime. She tends to young Caroline while Eleanor sleeps
exhaustedly. The narrative reveals Eleanor's precarious position - possessing
royal titles but no property or stable home. The Countess observes how war has
reduced nobles to refugees, all flowing like refuse toward Rotterdam and The
Hague. She completes her needlework journal, which contains intelligence about
French troop movements, while contemplating how her story parallels
Scheherazade's tales. The document represents both a spy report and a personal
testament of a woman fearing she might vanish without a trace.

Bonaventure Rossignol completes his decryption of the Countess's needlework
journal for King Louis XIV, revealing the full extent of her espionage. He notes
the subsequent destruction in the Palatinate, with Heidelberg Castle burning for
days and other cities marked for devastation. The Countess, pregnant with
Arcachon's child, now resides at the Hague under d'Avaux's surveillance. The
narrative shifts to Daniel Waterhouse in Sheerness, England, on December 11,
1688, where he discovers King James II being beaten by fishermen in a tavern.
The locals don't recognize their fleeing monarch, who had thrown the Great Seal
into the Thames before escaping London. They find his crucifix and suspect him
of being a Jesuit spy. Daniel, exhausted from searching for the King, observes
this surreal scene where the absolute monarch suffers the ultimate indignity. He
realizes James had timed his escape poorly, arriving at low tide, forcing him to
wait in this hostile tavern.

Daniel Waterhouse alerts the Gentleman of the Bedchamber about finding King
James II in the Sheerness tavern, triggering a rush of courtiers to the scene.
Despite the arrival of numerous Persons of Quality, the waterfront locals show
complete indifference to royal authority. Daniel observes the contrast between
the bright sunset illuminating his path toward London and the dark squalor
behind him where the King remains trapped. He stops at Castle Upnor, noting
signs of habitation and a two-masted vessel anchored nearby, suggesting the Earl
of Upnor may be preparing to flee. Daniel continues to Greenwich Observatory,
where he encounters the city ablaze with celebratory bonfires. From the hilltop,
he witnesses London's extraordinary brightness and hears the singing of
"Lilliburlero," the anti-Catholic anthem. He realizes the Glorious Revolution
has succeeded as an anticlimax - no civil war, no massacres, just gradual
change. This peaceful transformation challenges his Puritan expectation of
apocalyptic drama.

Daniel Waterhouse, suffering from a kidney stone, observes revolutionary London
from Greenwich hill before crossing to the Isle of Dogs. He spots the ship
Minerva preparing for an Atlantic voyage and considers escape to America. Mr.
Bhnh ferries him toward the Tower of London, where he enters through Traitor's
Gate. The Tower grounds are mysteriously filled with Irish refugees camping in
makeshift conditions. Daniel meets Sergeant Bob Shaftoe and mentions seeing the
Earl of Upnor at Castle Upnor. They discuss pursuing the Earl and searching for
Judge Jeffreys. On the causeway, Daniel encounters John Churchill, who expresses
uncertainty about loyalties in the new political order. Churchill reveals his
knowledge of Isaac Newton's presence in London and Enoch Root's arrival,
suspecting Daniel of alchemical involvement. They shake hands, forming an
alliance whereby Churchill will support Daniel's investigation into the
"esoteric brotherhood" in exchange for future reciprocal obligations. This marks
Daniel's entry into the complex political maneuvering of the revolutionary
moment.

Daniel and Bob Shaftoe navigate through Charing Cross, where celebratory
bonfires fill the square. They discover an unusual fire of changing colors
outside M. LeFebure's house, the city's chief alchemical headquarters. Servants
are burning books, maps, and mysterious substances that create brilliant colored
flames. Daniel observes a map of "Ye Islands of King Solomon" being consumed in
golden fire. Inside the house, he finds prominent figures salvaging select items
while destroying others. He encounters John Locke in conversation with someone
unseen, then enters a red-curtained room where Isaac Newton, the Earl of Upnor,
and Nicolas Fatio de Duilliers are meeting. Daniel interrupts to inform Upnor
that King James is at Sheerness, near Castle Upnor. The Earl reveals he plans to
depart for Upnor at dawn. Newton dismisses Daniel, citing his "incendiary
behavior" with alchemical texts in 1677. Daniel reflects on this strange
brotherhood that transcends religious and political divisions, understanding
Churchill's suspicions about their occult motives.

Daniel encounters Enoch Root outside the alchemical meeting, leading to a
philosophical confrontation about identity and purpose. Root challenges Daniel's
assumptions about human supremacy and defends his association with alchemists,
comparing himself to priests who visit madmen. Daniel condemns alchemy as an
obsolete pursuit, likening it to fantastical maps with sea monsters. He declares
the Glorious Revolution represents the triumph of empirical knowledge over
mystical nonsense. Daniel then meets with Newton, Upnor, and Fatio, noting how
their brotherhood transcends religious and political divisions that elsewhere
cause wars. Newton appears aged but still sharp at forty-six, wearing his
distinctive scarlet academic robe. The Earl of Upnor sports elaborate black
clothing embroidered with silver, armed with a Spanish rapier. When Daniel
informs them of King James's location at Sheerness, Upnor reveals he'll
personally travel to Castle Upnor at dawn, dismissing Daniel's offer of
assistance. Newton forbids Daniel from handling alchemical materials,
referencing an incident from 1677.

Daniel continues his confrontation with Enoch Root in the hallway, debating the
nature of alchemy versus natural philosophy. Root argues that the distinction
between alchemist and natural philosopher is recent and somewhat artificial.
Daniel compares alchemy to an archaic map filled with imaginary monsters and
islands, declaring it fitting that such maps burn on this revolutionary night.
He predicts that proper chronometers will soon enable accurate longitude
measurements, making real navigation possible. After leaving the alchemical
meeting, Daniel witnesses the systematic destruction of LeFebure's alchemical
library, with some items being preserved and packed into barrels for shipping.
The narrative captures the tension between the old mystical worldview
represented by the alchemists and the new empirical approach championed by
Daniel and the Royal Society. The Revolution marks not just political change but
an intellectual transformation, though Daniel observes how figures like Newton
straddle both worlds, making the transition more complex than a simple
replacement of superstition with reason.

Daniel track down Judge Jeffreys, who's attempting to flee England on a ship
called Hare. Daniel and Bob Shaftoe traverse London's docks, searching taverns
for the fugitive judge. After a perilous journey shooting London Bridge's
rapids, they find Jeffreys disguised in the Red Cow tavern, his eyebrows shaved
to avoid recognition. Daniel exposes Jeffreys' identity to the tavern's patrons,
reminding them of his crimes as the "Hanging Judge" who committed atrocities
during the Bloody Assizes. Trapped between the tavern keeper's shillelagh and
Bob's dagger, Jeffreys is cornered as soldiers arrive from the Tower. Daniel's
final words to Jeffreys, "You and I are but earth," mark the end of their long,
fraught relationship, as justice finally catches up with the notorious judge.

Leibniz writes to Eliza from Venice in July 1689, reporting on the successful
delivery of her letter and providing updates on global political changes. He
notes William and Mary's coronation, a new tall and clever Tsar Peter in Russia,
and territorial expansions to the Pacific. Venice continues pressing back the
Turks, while France and England devise new war financing methods - Louis XIV
melts palace silver while England creates national debt. Leibniz expresses
concern for the pregnant Eliza, knowing her attraction to financial markets
during upheavals. He discusses Princess Eleanor's situation, explaining how
German Protestant princesses like her, lacking wealth after family disputes,
become pawns in larger political machinations orchestrated by Sophie and Sophie
Charlotte. He predicts Eleanor will marry into German royalty while her daughter
Caroline, learning from powerful women like Eliza, will eventually control her
own destiny. Leibniz announces his new discipline called "dynamics" to study
force, positioning it against Newton's mystical approach.

Eliza writes to Leibniz from The Hague in August 1689, employing both plaintext
and encrypted messages to reveal the truth about her childbirth. She explains
how Princess Eleanor and Caroline visited her daily during pregnancy, with
Caroline showing remarkable curiosity about natural philosophy, inheriting her
late father's passion. Eliza recounts being ambushed during labor - instead of
reaching Eleanor's prepared birthing chamber, she was diverted to another room
where Dr. Alkmaar attended her difficult breech birth. Marie, one of her
assigned servants, suspiciously inquired about the baby's palate, revealing
French intelligence operations monitoring whether Étienne d'Arcachon's child
would inherit family deformities. Eliza deduces that Marie works for French
interests, likely connected to the new ambassador Montluçon and ultimately
d'Avaux. The letter reveals a complex web of court intrigue surrounding noble
bloodlines, with Étienne seeking healthy offspring to restore his family line,
while French agents monitor the birth's outcome for political leverage.

Eliza continues her encrypted letter, revealing how Dr. Alkmaar uses an
experimental drug from "the Red" (Enoch Root) to relax her muscles, enabling him
to turn the breech baby. She realizes Marie may have orders to ensure the
bastard child is stillborn, given its inconvenient status. When Marie and the
midwife whisper conspiratorially, Eliza sets fire to the bed curtains, causing
them to flee. Brigitte heroically drags Eliza on her mattress through the palace
gallery to Eleanor's chamber, where the trusted German midwife Frau Heppner
delivers the baby safely. Eliza reflects on how religion might restrain
Eleanor's potential vices as she entrusts her newborn son to the princess's
care. They circulate a cover story that the child is an orphan from a Palatinate
massacre. Living separately at Huygens's house while recovering, Eliza plans to
take the baby to London if she survives, but fears d'Avaux's schemes during her
vulnerable convalescence.

Eliza concludes her encrypted letter by revealing the true father of her healthy
child: Bonaventure Rossignol, the King's cryptanalyst, not Étienne d'Arcachon.
During the Rhine campaign, Rossignol rescued her from danger, leading to a
passionate affair. To facilitate her escape, she seduced Étienne as cover.
Rossignol, reading her journal for d'Avaux, cleverly edited his translation to
omit his own romantic role while making Eliza appear as Étienne's ideal breeding
partner. The baby inherits Rossignol's healthy bloodline rather than the
Arcachons' defects. Eliza struggles with separation from her son, her body
responding to his cries across the square. She asks Leibniz that if he meets
young Caroline accompanied by an orphan boy "born on the Rhine," he'll know the
child's true parentage. Meanwhile, in October 1689, Daniel Waterhouse prepares
for his voyage to Massachusetts, liquidating his London life while suffering
from kidney stones, visited by Samuel Pepys who attempts to convince him to have
surgery.

Daniel Waterhouse, gravely ill with kidney stones, receives a visit from Samuel
Pepys in October 1689. Pepys arrives with librarian assistants to purchase
Daniel's books as he prepares for Massachusetts. Despite Daniel's deteriorating
condition, Pepys enthusiastically advocates for surgical removal of the stone,
displaying his own removed stone and citing thirty years of added life. Daniel
refuses the risky procedure, preferring death to the surgery that killed his
mentor Wilkins. Pepys reveals he's organizing a farewell party at the Royal
Society, refusing to accept Daniel's protests about his weakness. Daniel is
carried in a sedan chair to Bedlam, where Hooke has prepared a gathering. The
party includes Newton, Fatio, Huygens, Boyle, Wren, and other luminaries. Roger
Comstock delivers a humorous toast about pure alcohol that won't trouble the
kidneys. As the evening progresses, Daniel gradually loses consciousness from
the strong spirits, dreaming briefly of proposing to Eliza before acknowledging
his current state makes such thoughts absurd.

Daniel awakens from his farewell party to find himself restrained in a chair by
elaborate rope work, facing surgical instruments laid out by Robert Hooke.
Multiple phosphorus lights illuminate the scene as Hooke prepares to perform
lithotomy surgery to remove Daniel's kidney stone, explaining he lacks mercy,
which makes him perfectly suited for the operation. Despite Daniel's protests,
Hooke proceeds with the dangerous procedure he calls "a pearl of great price,"
using instruments including probes, lancets, hooks, and rakes. A leather strap
is forced into Daniel's mouth as Hooke begins cutting. The chapter ends with an
extensive Dramatis Personae explaining the complex naming conventions of
nobility and listing key historical figures including the Anglesey family,
French nobles like d'Arcachon, members of Charles II's CABAL, scientists like
Leibniz and Newton, and the various Waterhouse family members. The list

including Jack Ketch (executioners), Gottfried Leibniz, John Locke, Isaac
Newton, Samuel Pepys, and various members of European nobility. Notable entries
include explanations of Louis XIV's family members and mistresses,
cryptographers like the Rossignols, Dutch military leaders, and the complex
genealogies of the Stuart, Bourbon, and German noble houses. The list
particularly details the House of Hanover through Sophie and her descendants,
who would later claim the English throne. The Waterhouse family tree is
extensively documented, showing Daniel's place among Puritan merchants and
colonists. Each entry provides birth/death dates and key relationships, creating

noble titles. Author's acknowledgments follow, crediting the extensive scholarly
web underlying the work while acknowledging fictional departures from historical
truth. Key scholarly influences include works on the period's major figures,
with special mention of Fernand Braudel's historical approach. The author thanks
various individuals for access to historical sites and research materials,
including connections at Cambridge and period reenactors who provided expertise
on subjects like gunpowder. Publishing support came from multiple editors and
agents who showed "superhuman patience" with the project. The acknowledgments
emphasize that while building on serious scholarship, the work takes creative
liberties, and readers seeking historical accuracy should consult the original
scholarly sources. The section ends by recognizing the centuries-long
intellectual tradition from Wilkins and Comenius forward that made such a work
possible.
